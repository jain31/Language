" Nature in the broadest sense, is the natural, physical, material world or universe.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""Nature"" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The word nature is borrowed from the Old French nature and is derived from the Latin word natura, or ""essential qualities, innate disposition"", and in ancient times, literally meant ""birth"".",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In ancient philosophy, natura is mostly used as the Latin translation of the Greek word physis (φύσις), which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics that plants, animals, and other features of the world develop of their own accord.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"
The concept of nature as a whole, the physical universe, is one of several expansions of the original notion;[1] it began with certain core applications of the word φύσις by pre-Socratic philosophers (though this word had a dynamic dimension then, especially for Heraclitus), and has steadily gained currency ever since.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"During the advent of modern scientific method in the last several centuries, nature became the passive reality, organized and moved by divine laws.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"With the Industrial revolution, nature increasingly became seen as the part of reality deprived from intentional intervention : it was hence considered as sacred by some traditions (Rousseau, American transcendentalism) or a mere decorum for divine providence or human history (Hegel, Marx).",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However, a vitalist vision of nature, closer to the presocratic one, got reborn at the same time, especially after Charles Darwin.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Within the various uses of the word today, ""nature"" often refers to geology and wildlife.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Nature can refer to the general realm of living plants and animals, and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate objects—the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as the weather and geology of the Earth.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It is often taken to mean the ""natural environment"" or wilderness—wild animals, rocks, forest, and in general those things that have not been substantially altered by human intervention, or which persist despite human intervention.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For example, manufactured objects and human interaction generally are not considered part of nature, unless qualified as, for example, ""human nature"" or ""the whole of nature"".",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This more traditional concept of natural things that can still be found today implies a distinction between the natural and the artificial, with the artificial being understood as that which has been brought into being by a human consciousness or a human mind.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Depending on the particular context, the term ""natural"" might also be distinguished from the unnatural or the supernatural.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Earth is the only planet known to support life, and its natural features are the subject of many fields of scientific research.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Within the solar system, it is third closest to the sun; it is the largest terrestrial planet and the fifth largest overall.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Its most prominent climatic features are its two large polar regions, two relatively narrow temperate zones, and a wide equatorial tropical to subtropical region.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Precipitation varies widely with location, from several metres of water per year to less than a millimetre.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 percent of the Earth's surface is covered by salt-water oceans.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The remainder consists of continents and islands, with most of the inhabited land in the Northern Hemisphere.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Earth has evolved through geological and biological processes that have left traces of the original conditions.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The outer surface is divided into several gradually migrating tectonic plates.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The interior remains active, with a thick layer of plastic mantle and an iron-filled core that generates a magnetic field.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This iron core is composed of a solid inner phase, and a fluid outer phase.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Convective motion in the core generates electric currents through dynamo action, and these, in turn, generate the geomagnetic field.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The atmospheric conditions have been significantly altered from the original conditions by the presence of life-forms,[8] which create an ecological balance that stabilizes the surface conditions.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Despite the wide regional variations in climate by latitude and other geographic factors, the long-term average global climate is quite stable during interglacial periods,[9] and variations of a degree or two of average global temperature have historically had major effects on the ecological balance, and on the actual geography of the Earth.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Geology is the science and study of the solid and liquid matter that constitutes the earth.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The field of geology encompasses the study of the composition, structure, physical properties, dynamics, and history of Earth materials, and the processes by which they are formed, moved, and changed.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The field is a major academic discipline, and is also important for mineral and hydrocarbon extraction, knowledge about and mitigation of natural hazards, some Geotechnical engineering fields, and understanding past climates and environments.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The geology of an area evolves through time as rock units are deposited and inserted and deformational processes change their shapes and locations.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rock units are first emplaced either by deposition onto the surface or intrude into the overlying rock.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Deposition can occur when sediments settle onto the surface of the Earth and later lithify into sedimentary rock, or when as volcanic material such as volcanic ash or lava flows, blanket the surface.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Igneous intrusions such as batholiths, laccoliths, dikes, and sills, push upwards into the overlying rock, and crystallize as they intrude.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"After the initial sequence of rocks has been deposited, the rock units can be deformed and/or metamorphosed.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Deformation typically occurs as a result of horizontal shortening, horizontal extension, or side-to-side (strike-slip) motion.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"These structural regimes broadly relate to convergent boundaries, divergent boundaries, and transform boundaries, respectively, between tectonic plates.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Earth is estimated to have formed 4.54 billion years ago from the solar nebula, along with the Sun and other planets.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The moon formed roughly 20 million years later.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Initially molten, the outer layer of the Earth cooled, resulting in the solid crust.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Outgassing and volcanic activity produced the primordial atmosphere.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Condensing water vapor, most or all of which came from ice delivered by comets, produced the oceans and other water sources.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The highly energetic chemistry is believed to have produced a self-replicating molecule around 4 billion years ago.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Continents formed, then broke up and reformed as the surface of Earth reshaped over hundreds of millions of years, occasionally combining to make a supercontinent.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Roughly 750 million years ago, the earliest known supercontinent Rodinia, began to break apart.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The continents later recombined to form Pannotia which broke apart about  million years ago, then finally Pangaea, which broke apart about 180 million years ago.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" During the Neoproterozoic era, freezing temperatures covered much of the Earth in glaciers and ice sheets.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This hypothesis has been termed the ""Snowball Earth"", and it is of particular interest as it precedes the Cambrian explosion in which multicellular life forms began to proliferate about 530–540 million years ago.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Since the Cambrian explosion there have been five distinctly identifiable mass extinctions.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The last mass extinction occurred some 66 million years ago, when a meteorite collision probably triggered the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs and other large reptiles, but spared small animals such as mammals.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Over the past 66 million years, mammalian life diversified.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Several million years ago, a species of small African ape gained the ability to stand upright.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The subsequent advent of human life, and the development of agriculture and further civilization allowed humans to affect the Earth more rapidly than any previous life form, affecting both the nature and quantity of other organisms as well as global climate.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"By comparison, the Great Oxygenation Event, produced by the proliferation of algae during the Siderian period, required about 300 million years to culminate.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The present era is classified as part of a mass extinction event, the Holocene extinction event, the fastest ever to have occurred.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Some, such as E. O. Wilson of Harvard University, predict that human destruction of the biosphere could cause the extinction of one-half of all species in the next 100 years.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The extent of the current extinction event is still being researched, debated and calculated by biologists.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Earth's atmosphere is a key factor in sustaining the ecosystem.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The thin layer of gases that envelops the Earth is held in place by gravity.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Air is mostly nitrogen, oxygen, water vapor, with much smaller amounts of carbon dioxide, argon, etc.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The atmospheric pressure declines steadily with altitude.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The ozone layer plays an important role in depleting the amount of ultraviolet (UV) radiation that reaches the surface.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As DNA is readily damaged by UV light, this serves to protect life at the surface.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The atmosphere also retains heat during the night, thereby reducing the daily temperature extremes.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Terrestrial weather occurs almost exclusively in the lower part of the atmosphere, and serves as a convective system for redistributing heat.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ocean currents are another important factor in determining climate, particularly the major underwater thermohaline circulation which distributes heat energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
These currents help to moderate the differences in temperature between winter and summer in the temperate zones.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Also, without the redistributions of heat energy by the ocean currents and atmosphere, the tropics would be much hotter, and the polar regions much colder.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Weather can have both beneficial and harmful effects.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Extremes in weather, such as tornadoes or hurricanes and cyclones, can expend large amounts of energy along their paths, and produce devastation.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Surface vegetation has evolved a dependence on the seasonal variation of the weather, and sudden changes lasting only a few years can have a dramatic effect, both on the vegetation and on the animals which depend on its growth for their food.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Climate is a measure of the long-term trends in the weather.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Various factors are known to influence the climate, including ocean currents, surface albedo, greenhouse gases, variations in the solar luminosity, and changes to the Earth's orbit.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Based on historical records, the Earth is known to have undergone drastic climate changes in the past, including ice ages.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The climate of a region depends on a number of factors, especially latitude.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A latitudinal band of the surface with similar climatic attributes forms a climate region.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"There are a number of such regions, ranging from the tropical climate at the equator to the polar climate in the northern and southern extremes.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Weather is also influenced by the seasons, which result from the Earth's axis being tilted relative to its orbital plane.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Thus, at any given time during the summer or winter, one part of the Earth is more directly exposed to the rays of the sun.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This exposure alternates as the Earth revolves in its orbit.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At any given time, regardless of season, the northern and southern hemispheres experience opposite seasons.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Weather is a chaotic system that is readily modified by small changes to the environment, so accurate weather forecasting is limited to only a few days.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Overall, two things are happening worldwide:  temperature is increasing on the average; and regional climates have been undergoing noticeable changes.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Water is a chemical substance that is composed of hydrogen and oxygen (H2O) and is vital for all known forms of life.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" In typical usage, water refers only to its liquid form or state, but the substance also has a solid state, ice, and a gaseous state, water vapor, or steam.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Water covers 71% of the Earth's surface.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" On Earth, it is found mostly in oceans and other large bodies of water, with 1.6% of water below ground in aquifers and 0.001% in the air as vapor, clouds, and precipitation.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Oceans hold 97% of surface water, glaciers, and polar ice caps 2.4%, and other land surface water such as rivers, lakes, and ponds 0.6%.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Additionally, a minute amount of the Earth's water is contained within biological bodies and manufactured products.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"An ocean is a major body of saline water, and a principal component of the hydrosphere.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Approximately 71% of the Earth's surface (an area of some 361 million square kilometers) is covered by ocean, a continuous body of water that is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller seas.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"More than half of this area is over 3,000 meters (9,800 feet) deep.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Average oceanic salinity is around 35 parts per thousand (ppt) (3.5%), and nearly all seawater has a salinity in the range of 30 to 38 ppt.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Though generally recognized as several 'separate' oceans, these waters comprise one global, interconnected body of salt water often referred to as the World Ocean or global ocean.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 This concept of a global ocean as a continuous body of water with relatively free interchange among its parts is of fundamental importance to oceanography.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The major oceanic divisions are defined in part by the continents, various archipelagos, and other criteria: these divisions are (in descending order of size) the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, the Southern Ocean, and the Arctic Ocean.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Smaller regions of the oceans are called seas, gulfs, bays and other names.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"There are also salt lakes, which are smaller bodies of landlocked saltwater that are not interconnected with the World Ocean.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Two notable examples of salt lakes are the Aral Sea and the Great Salt Lake.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A lake (from Latin word lacus) is a terrain feature (or physical feature), a body of liquid on the surface of a world that is localized to the bottom of basin (another type of landform or terrain feature; that is, it is not global) and moves slowly if it moves at all.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"On Earth, a body of water is considered a lake when it is inland, not part of the ocean, is larger and deeper than a pond, and is fed by a river.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The only world other than Earth known to harbor lakes is Titan, Saturn's largest moon, which has lakes of ethane, most likely mixed with methane.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It is not known if Titan's lakes are fed by rivers, though Titan's surface is carved by numerous river beds.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Natural lakes on Earth are generally found in mountainous areas, rift zones, and areas with ongoing or recent glaciation.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Other lakes are found in endorheic basins or along the courses of mature rivers.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In some parts of the world, there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last Ice Age.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"All lakes are temporary over geologic time scales, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A pond is a body of standing water, either natural or man-made, that is usually smaller than a lake.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A wide variety of man-made bodies of water are classified as ponds, including water gardens designed for aesthetic ornamentation, fish ponds designed for commercial fish breeding, and solar ponds designed to store thermal energy.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ponds and lakes are distinguished from streams via current speed.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"While currents in streams are easily observed, ponds and lakes possess thermally driven micro-currents and moderate wind driven currents.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"These features distinguish a pond from many other aquatic terrain features, such as stream pools and tide pools.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A river is a natural watercourse,[38] usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, a lake, a sea or another river.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In a few cases, a river simply flows into the ground or dries up completely before reaching another body of water.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Small rivers may also be called by several other names, including stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill; there is no general rule that defines what can be called a river.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; one example is Burn in Scotland and North-east England.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sometimes a river is said to be larger than a creek, but this is not always the case, due to vagueness in the language.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 A river is part of the hydrological cycle.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Water within a river is generally collected from precipitation through surface runoff, groundwater recharge, springs, and the release of stored water in natural ice and snowpacks (i.e., from glaciers).",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A stream is a flowing body of water with a current, confined within a bed and stream banks.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the United States, a stream is classified as a watercourse less than  feet ( metres) wide.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Streams are important as conduits in the water cycle, instruments in groundwater recharge, and they serve as corridors for fish and wildlife migration.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The biological habitat in the immediate vicinity of a stream is called a riparian zone.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Given the status of the ongoing Holocene extinction, streams play an important corridor role in connecting fragmented habitats and thus in conserving biodiversity.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The study of streams and waterways in general involves many branches of inter-disciplinary natural science and engineering, including hydrology, fluvial geomorphology, aquatic ecology, fish biology, riparian ecology, and others.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ecosystems are composed of a variety of biotic and abiotic components that function in an interrelated way.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The structure and composition is determined by various environmental factors that are interrelated.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Variations of these factors will initiate dynamic modifications to the ecosystem.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Some of the more important components are soil, atmosphere, radiation from the sun, water, and living organisms.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Central to the ecosystem concept is the idea that living organisms interact with every other element in their local environment.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Eugene Odum, a founder of ecology, stated: ""Any unit that includes all of the organisms (ie: the ""community"") in a given area interacting with the physical environment so that a flow of energy leads to clearly defined trophic structure, biotic diversity, and material cycles (i.e.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
: exchange of materials between living and nonliving parts) within the system is an ecosystem.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Within the ecosystem, species are connected and dependent upon one another in the food chain, and exchange energy and matter between themselves as well as with their environment.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The human ecosystem concept is based on the human/nature dichotomy and the idea that all species are ecologically dependent on each other, as well as with the abiotic constituents of their biotope.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A smaller unit of size is called a microecosystem.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For example, a microsystem can be a stone and all the life under it.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A macroecosystem might involve a whole ecoregion, with its drainage basin.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Wilderness is generally defined as areas that have not been significantly modified by human activity.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Wilderness areas can be found in preserves, estates, farms, conservation preserves, ranches, national forests, national parks, and even in urban areas along rivers, gulches, or otherwise undeveloped areas.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Wilderness areas and protected parks are considered important for the survival of certain species, ecological studies, conservation, and solitude.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Some nature writers believe wilderness areas are vital for the human spirit and creativity,[46] and some ecologists consider wilderness areas to be an integral part of the Earth's self-sustaining natural ecosystem (the biosphere).",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"They may also preserve historic genetic traits and that they provide habitat for wild flora and fauna that may be difficult or impossible to recreate in zoos, arboretums, or laboratories.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Although there is no universal agreement on the definition of life, scientists generally accept that the biological manifestation of life is characterized by organization, metabolism, growth, adaptation, response to stimuli, and reproduction.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Life may also be said to be simply the characteristic state of organisms.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Properties common to terrestrial organisms (plants, animals, fungi, protists, archaea, and bacteria) are that they are cellular, carbon-and-water-based with complex organization, having a metabolism, a capacity to grow, respond to stimuli, and reproduce.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
An entity with these properties is generally considered life.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However, not every definition of life considers all of these properties to be essential.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Human-made analogs of life may also be considered to be life.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The biosphere is the part of Earth's outer shell—including land, surface rocks, water, air and the atmosphere—within which life occurs, and which biotic processes in turn alter or transform.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"From the broadest geophysiological point of view, the biosphere is the global ecological system integrating all living beings and their relationships, including their interaction with the elements of the lithosphere (rocks), hydrosphere (water), and atmosphere (air).",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The entire Earth contains over  billion tons ( trillion pounds or about ×1013 kilograms) of biomass (life), which lives within various environments within the biosphere.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Over nine-tenths of the total biomass on Earth is plant life, on which animal life depends very heavily for its existence.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" More than 2 million species of plant and animal life have been identified to date,[50] and estimates of the actual number of existing species range from several million to well over 50 million.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The number of individual species of life is constantly in some degree of flux, with new species appearing and others ceasing to exist on a continual basis.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The total number of species is in rapid decline.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" The origin of life on Earth is not well understood, but it is known to have occurred at least 3.5 billion years ago,[61][62][63] during the hadean or archean eons on a primordial Earth that had a substantially different environment than is found at present.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 These life forms possessed the basic traits of self-replication and inheritable traits.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Once life had appeared, the process of evolution by natural selection resulted in the development of ever-more diverse life forms.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Species that were unable to adapt to the changing environment and competition from other life forms became extinct.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However, the fossil record retains evidence of many of these older species.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Current fossil and DNA evidence shows that all existing species can trace a continual ancestry back to the first primitive life forms.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 When basic forms of plant life developed the process of photosynthesis the sun's energy could be harvested to create conditions which allowed for more complex life forms.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 The resultant oxygen accumulated in the atmosphere and gave rise to the ozone layer.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted in the development of yet more complex cells called eukaryotes.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Cells within colonies became increasingly specialized, resulting in true multicellular organisms.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"With the ozone layer absorbing harmful ultraviolet radiation, life colonized the surface of Earth.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The first form of life to develop on the Earth were microbes, and they remained the only form of life until about a billion years ago when multi-cellular organisms began to appear.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Microorganisms are single-celled organisms that are generally microscopic, and smaller than the human eye can see.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"They include Bacteria, Fungi, Archaea, and Protista.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"These life forms are found in almost every location on the Earth where there is liquid water, including in the Earth's interior.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"
Their reproduction is both rapid and profuse.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The combination of a high mutation rate and a horizontal gene transfer[69] ability makes them highly adaptable, and able to survive in new environments, including outer space.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They form an essential part of the planetary ecosystem.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However, some microorganisms are pathogenic and can post health risk to other organisms.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Originally Aristotle divided all living things between plants, which generally do not move fast enough for humans to notice, and animals.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In Linnaeus' system, these became the kingdoms Vegetabilia (later Plantae) and Animalia.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Since then, it has become clear that the Plantae as originally defined included several unrelated groups, and the fungi and several groups of algae were removed to new kingdoms.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However, these are still often considered plants in many contexts.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Bacterial life is sometimes included in flora,[71][72] and some classifications use the term bacterial flora separately from plant flora.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Among the many ways of classifying plants are by regional floras, which, depending on the purpose of study, can also include fossil flora, remnants of plant life from a previous era.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"People in many regions and countries take great pride in their individual arrays of characteristic flora, which can vary widely across the globe due to differences in climate and terrain.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Regional floras commonly are divided into categories such as native flora and agricultural and garden flora, the lastly mentioned of which are intentionally grown and cultivated.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Some types of ""native flora"" actually have been introduced centuries ago by people migrating from one region or continent to another, and become an integral part of the native, or natural flora of the place to which they were introduced.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is an example of how human interaction with nature can blur the boundary of what is considered nature.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Another category of plant has historically been carved out for weeds.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Though the term has fallen into disfavor among botanists as a formal way to categorize ""useless"" plants, the informal use of the word ""weeds"" to describe those plants that are deemed worthy of elimination is illustrative of the general tendency of people and societies to seek to alter or shape the course of nature.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Similarly, animals are often categorized in ways such as domestic, farm animals, wild animals, pests, etc.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
according to their relationship to human life.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Animals as a category have several characteristics that generally set them apart from other living things.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Animals are eukaryotic and usually multicellular (although see Myxozoa), which separates them from bacteria, archaea, and most protists.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"They are heterotrophic, generally digesting food in an internal chamber, which separates them from plants and algae.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"They are also distinguished from plants, algae, and fungi by lacking cell walls.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
With a few exceptions—most notably the two phyla consisting of sponges and placozoans—animals have bodies that are differentiated into tissues.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"These include muscles, which are able to contract and control locomotion, and a nervous system, which sends and processes signals.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There is also typically an internal digestive chamber.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The eukaryotic cells possessed by all animals are surrounded by a characteristic extracellular matrix composed of collagen and elastic glycoproteins.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This may be calcified to form structures like shells, bones, and spicules, a framework upon which cells can move about and be reorganized during development and maturation, and which supports the complex anatomy required for mobility.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Although humans comprise only a minuscule proportion of the total living biomass on Earth, the human effect on nature is disproportionately large.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Because of the extent of human influence, the boundaries between what humans regard as nature and ""made environments"" is not clear cut except at the extremes.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Even at the extremes, the amount of natural environment that is free of discernible human influence is diminishing at an increasingly rapid pace.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The development of technology by the human race has allowed the greater exploitation of natural resources and has helped to alleviate some of the risk from natural hazards.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In spite of this progress, however, the fate of human civilization remains closely linked to changes in the environment.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There exists a highly complex feedback loop between the use of advanced technology and changes to the environment that are only slowly becoming understood.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[73] Man-made threats to the Earth's natural environment include pollution, deforestation, and disasters such as oil spills.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Humans have contributed to the extinction of many plants and animals.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Humans employ nature for both leisure and economic activities.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The acquisition of natural resources for industrial use remains a sizable component of the world's economic system.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Some activities, such as hunting and fishing, are used for both sustenance and leisure, often by different people.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Agriculture was first adopted around the 9th millennium BCE.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ranging from food production to energy, nature influences economic wealth.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Although early humans gathered uncultivated plant materials for food and employed the medicinal properties of vegetation for healing,[76] most modern human use of plants is through agriculture.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The clearance of large tracts of land for crop growth has led to a significant reduction in the amount available of forestation and wetlands, resulting in the loss of habitat for many plant and animal species as well as increased erosion.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Beauty in nature has historically been a prevalent theme in art and books, filling large sections of libraries and bookstores.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"That nature has been depicted and celebrated by so much art, photography, poetry, and other literature shows the strength with which many people associate nature and beauty.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Reasons why this association exists, and what the association consists of, are studied by the branch of philosophy called aesthetics.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Beyond certain basic characteristics that many philosophers agree about to explain what is seen as beautiful, the opinions are virtually endless.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Nature and wildness have been important subjects in various eras of world history.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
An early tradition of landscape art began in China during the Tang Dynasty (618–907).,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The tradition of representing nature as it is became one of the aims of Chinese painting and was a significant influence in Asian art.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Although natural wonders are celebrated in the Psalms and the Book of Job, wilderness portrayals in art became more prevalent in the 1800s, especially in the works of the Romantic movement.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
British artists John Constable and J. M. W. Turner turned their attention to capturing the beauty of the natural world in their paintings.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Before that, paintings had been primarily of religious scenes or of human beings.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"William Wordsworth's poetry described the wonder of the natural world, which had formerly been viewed as a threatening place.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Increasingly the valuing of nature became an aspect of Western culture.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 This artistic movement also coincided with the Transcendentalist movement in the Western world.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A common classical idea of beautiful art involves the word mimesis, the imitation of nature.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Also in the realm of ideas about beauty in nature is that the perfect is implied through perfect mathematical forms and more generally by patterns in nature.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As David Rothenburg writes, ""The beautiful is the root of science and the goal of art, the highest possibility that humanity can ever hope to see"".",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For this reason the most fundamental science is generally understood to be ""physics""—the name for which is still recognizable as meaning that it is the ""study of nature"".",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Matter is commonly defined as the substance of which physical objects are composed.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It constitutes the observable universe.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The visible components of the universe are now believed to compose only 4.9 percent of the total mass.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The remainder is believed to consist of 26.8 percent cold dark matter and 68.3 percent dark energy.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The exact arrangement of these components is still unknown and is under intensive investigation by physicists.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The behaviour of matter and energy throughout the observable universe appears to follow well-defined physical laws.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
These laws have been employed to produce cosmological models that successfully explain the structure and the evolution of the universe we can observe.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The mathematical expressions of the laws of physics employ a set of twenty physical constants[82] that appear to be static across the observable universe.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" The values of these constants have been carefully measured, but the reason for their specific values remains a mystery.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Outer space, also simply called space, refers to the relatively empty regions of the Universe outside the atmospheres of celestial bodies.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Outer space is used to distinguish it from airspace (and terrestrial locations).,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"There is no discrete boundary between Earth's atmosphere and space, as the atmosphere gradually attenuates with increasing altitude.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Outer space within the Solar System is called interplanetary space, which passes over into interstellar space at what is known as the heliopause.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Outer space is sparsely filled with several dozen types of organic molecules discovered to date by microwave spectroscopy, blackbody radiation left over from the Big Bang and the origin of the universe, and cosmic rays, which include ionized atomic nuclei and various subatomic particles.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"There is also some gas, plasma and dust, and small meteors.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Additionally, there are signs of human life in outer space today, such as material left over from previous manned and unmanned launches which are a potential hazard to spacecraft.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Some of this debris re-enters the atmosphere periodically.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Although Earth is the only body within the solar system known to support life, evidence suggests that in the distant past the planet Mars possessed bodies of liquid water on the surface.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For a brief period in Mars' history, it may have also been capable of forming life.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At present though, most of the water remaining on Mars is frozen.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If life exists at all on Mars, it is most likely to be located underground where liquid water can still exist.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Conditions on the other terrestrial planets, Mercury and Venus, appear to be too harsh to support life as we know it.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"But it has been conjectured that Europa, the fourth-largest moon of Jupiter, may possess a sub-surface ocean of liquid water and could potentially host life.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Astronomers have started to discover extrasolar Earth analogs – planets that lie in the habitable zone of space surrounding a star, and therefore could possibly host life as we know it.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Media: Organizations: Philosophy:   Wikipedia (/ˌwɪkɪˈpiːdiə/ (listen) wik-ih-PEE-dee-ə or /ˌwɪki-/ (listen) wik-ee-) is a multilingual open-collaborative online encyclopedia created and maintained by a community of volunteer editors using a wiki-based editing system.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It is one of the 15 most popular websites as ranked by Alexa, as of January 2021[update][3] and The Economist newspaper placed it as the ""13th-most-visited place on the web"".",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Featuring no advertisements, it is hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation, an American non-profit organization funded primarily through donations.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001, by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sanger coined its name as a portmanteau of ""wiki"" and ""encyclopedia"".",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It was initially an English-language encyclopedia, but versions in other languages were quickly developed.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"With 6.2 million articles, the English Wikipedia is the largest of the 317 Wikipedia encyclopedias.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Overall, Wikipedia comprises more than 55 million articles,[7] attracting 1.7 billion unique visitors per month.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Wikipedia has been criticized for its uneven accuracy and for exhibiting systemic bias, including gender bias, with the majority of editors being male.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Edit-a-thons have been held to encourage female editors and increase the coverage of women's topics.,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 2006, Time magazine stated that the open-door policy of allowing anyone to edit had made Wikipedia the biggest and possibly the best encyclopedia in the world, and was a testament to the vision of Jimmy Wales.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The project's reputation improved further in the 2010s as it increased efforts to improve its quality and reliability, based on its unique structure, curation and absence of commercial bias.",English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ആ ആശയത്തിനെ പ്രാവർത്തികമാക്കാനുള്ള ആദ്യശ്രമം റിക്ക് ഗേറ്റ്സിന്റെ ഇന്റർപീഡിയ ആയിരുന്നു[7][8].,Malayalam,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
എങ്കിലും അത്‌ പ്ലാനിങ് ഘട്ടം കഴിഞ്ഞ് അധികം മുന്നോട്ടുപോയില്ല.,Malayalam,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

അതുകൊണ്ടൊക്കെ തന്നെ വിക്കിപീഡിയ ചിലമേഖലകളെ പ്രതിനിധാനം ചെയ്യുന്നില്ല.,Malayalam,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
സ്വന്തം കണ്ടെത്തലുകളും കാഴ്ചപ്പാടുകളും മാറ്റിനിർത്തി ലേഖനങ്ങളെഴുതുക എന്നതാണ് വിക്കിപീഡിയയുടെ ശൈലിയും കീഴ്‌വഴക്കവും.,Malayalam,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
അതായത് എഴുതപ്പെടുന്ന കാര്യങ്ങൾക്ക് വ്യക്തമായ തെളിവുകളുണ്ടാകണം.,Malayalam,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

വിശ്വാസയോഗ്യമായ രേഖകൾ പരിശോധിച്ച് ലേഖനങ്ങളെഴുതുക എന്നതു തുടക്കത്തിൽ ശ്രമകരമായിത്തോന്നാം.,Malayalam,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
എന്നാൽ വിക്കിപീഡിയയിലെ സജീവ പ്രവർത്തനത്തിലൂടെ ഇക്കാര്യത്തിലും പരിചയം നേടിയെടുക്കാവുന്നതേയുള്ളൂ.,Malayalam,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
എഴുതുന്ന കാര്യങ്ങൾക്കെല്ലാം തെളിവുകൾ വേണം എന്നതുകൊണ്ട് എല്ലാവരികൾക്കും ഉറവിടം ചേർത്തുകൊള്ളണം എന്നില്ല.,Malayalam,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ഒട്ടുമിക്ക ലേഖനങ്ങളിലും പ്രധാന റഫറൻസ് ദിനപത്രങ്ങളാണ്.,Malayalam,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

കാരണം നമ്മുടെ പത്രങ്ങൾ ഒക്കെ ഇപ്പോഴും യൂണികോഡ് ഫോണ്ട് ഉപയോഗിക്കാൻ തുടങ്ങിയിട്ടില്ല എന്നതാണ്.,Malayalam,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
കേരളത്തിനുള്ളിൽ നിന്നും പ്രവർത്തിക്കുന്ന വിക്കിപീഡിയർ ഏറെയുണ്ടാകുന്നതുകൊണ്ടുള്ള മറ്റൊരു സുപ്രധാനനേട്ടവും ഈ റഫറൻസുകളുമായി ബന്ധപ്പെട്ടിരിക്കുന്നു.,Malayalam,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
കേരള ചരിത്രത്തെപ്പറ്റിയും സംസ്കാരത്തെപ്പറ്റിയുമൊക്കെയുള്ള ഗ്രന്ഥങ്ങളും ലേഖനങ്ങളും എളുപ്പത്തിൽ കണ്ടെത്താം എന്നതിനാൽ കേരളത്തിലുള്ളവർക്ക് ആധികാരിക രേഖകൾ അടിസ്ഥാനമാക്കി ലേഖനങ്ങളെഴുതുക കൂടുതൽ സൗകര്യപ്രദമാണ്.,Malayalam,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
മലയാളം വിക്കിപീഡിയ കേരളത്തിനുള്ളിൽ നിന്നും കൂടുതൽ പ്രവർത്തകരെ സ്വാഗതം ചെയ്യുന്നതും ഇക്കാരണം കൊണ്ടാണ്.,Malayalam,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
വിക്കിപീഡിയയിലെ ഒരു ലേഖനത്തിനും കൃത്യമായൊരു രചയിതാവില്ല.,Malayalam,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
അതായത്‌ ഒരു ലേഖനത്തിനു പിന്നിൽ പ്രവർത്തിച്ചവർ പലരുണ്ടാവും.അവരുടെ കാഴ്ചപ്പാടുകളും വ്യത്യസ്തമാവും.,Malayalam,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"അതുകൊണ്ടുതന്നെ, എല്ലാവർക്കും ഒരു പോലെ യോജിക്കാനാവുന്ന ഒരു മധ്യമാ‍ർഗത്തിനേ വിക്കിയിലെ ലേഖനങ്ങളിൽ നിലനിൽപ്പുണ്ടാവൂ.",Malayalam,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ഇനി ഒരാൾക്ക് തന്റെ കാഴ്ചപ്പാട് വിക്കിപീഡിയയിൽ ഇല്ല എന്നു തോന്നിയെന്നിരിക്കട്ടെ, അയാൾക്ക് അത് സ്വയം സ്രോതസ്സിന്റെ പിൻബലത്തോടെ വിക്കിപീഡിയയിൽ ചേർക്കാവുന്നതാണ്.",Malayalam,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ഇംഗ്ലീഷ് പദങ്ങളുടെ മലയാളീകരണമാണ് പ്രശ്നമുള്ള മറ്റൊരു മേഖല.,Malayalam,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
പല ഇംഗ്ലീഷ് പദങ്ങൾക്കും തുല്യമായ മലയാളം പദമില്ലാത്തതിനാൽ ചിലർ അവിടെ അതേ പദം തന്നെ മലയാളം ലിപിയിൽ ഉപയോഗിക്കുന്നു.,Malayalam,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
മറ്റു ചിലരാകട്ടെ അവയ്ക്ക് സ്വന്തം കഴിവനുസരിച്ച് മലയാളം പദങ്ങൾ സൃഷ്ടിച്ച് ഉപയോഗിക്കുന്നു.,Malayalam,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
മലയാളം വിക്കിപീഡിയയിൽ ഉപയോക്താക്കളുടെ എണ്ണം വളരെയധികം ഇല്ലാത്തതിനാൽ ഇത്തരം കാര്യങ്ങളെല്ലാം ഇന്ന് കുഴഞ്ഞുമറിഞ്ഞു കിടക്കുകയാണ്.,Malayalam,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
മലയാളം വിക്കിപീഡിയയിൽ ലേഖകരുടെ എണ്ണം വർദ്ധിക്കുമ്പോൾ ഇത്തരം പ്രശ്നം എല്ലാം പരിഹരിക്കപ്പെടുമെന്നാണ് പൊതുവേ വിശ്വസിക്കുന്നത്.,Malayalam,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ലേഖനത്തെ തിരുത്തൽ യുദ്ധത്തിൽ നിന്നും സംരക്ഷിക്കേണ്ട ചുമതലയും പലപ്പോഴും ഇവർക്കാണ്.,Malayalam,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
വിക്കിപീഡിയക്കായി സേവനങ്ങൾ ചെയ്യാൻ സന്നദ്ധരായവരെ പൊതുവേ വിക്കിപീഡിയർ എന്നു വിളിക്കുന്നു.,Malayalam,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 कॉमंस (विकिमीडिया प्रकल्प का मीडिया फ़ाइल भंडार) 
 विकिसमाचार (मुक्त समाचार) योगदानकर्ताओं के लिए: यह लेख इंटरनेट (इण्टरनेट) विश्वकोश के बारे में बतलाता  है। कि विकिपीडिया के मुख्य पृष्ठ के लिए, विकिपीडिया का मुख्य पृष्ठ देखें। विकिपीडिया के आगंतुक परिचय के लिए, विकिपीडिया के बारे में पृष्ठ देखें। विकिपीडिया  एक मुफ्त,[5] वेब आधारित और सहयोगी बहुभाषी विश्वकोश है, जो गैर-लाभ विकिमीडिया फाउनडेशन से सहयोग प्राप्त परियोजना में उत्पन्न हुआ। इसका नाम दो शब्दों विकी (wiki) (यह सहयोगी वेबसाइटों के निर्माण की एक तकनीक है, यह एक हवाई शब्द विकी है जिसका अर्थ है ""जल्दी"") और एनसाइक्लोपीडिया (encyclopedia) का संयोजन है। 
दुनिया भर में स्वयंसेवकों के द्वारा सहयोग से विकिपीडिया के 1.3 करोड़ लेख (29 लाख अंग्रेजी विकिपीडिया में) लिखे गए हैं और इसके लगभग सभी लेखों को वह कोई भी व्यक्ति संपादित कर सकता है, जो विकिपीडिया वेबसाईट का उपयोग कर सकता है। [6] इसे जनवरी 2001 में जिम्मी वेल्स और लेरी सेंगर के द्वारा प्रारंभ (प्रारम्भ) किया गया,[7] यह वर्तमान में इंटरनेट (इण्टरनेट) पर सबसे लोकप्रिय संदर्भित कार्य है। 
[3][8][9][10] विकिपीडिया के आलोचक इसे व्यवस्थित पूर्वाग्रह और असंगतियों को दोषी ठहराते हैं,[11] और आरोप लगते हैं कि यह इसकी सम्पादकीय प्रक्रिया में उपलब्धियों पर सहमति का पक्ष लेती है।[12]
[13] विकिपीडिया की विश्वसनीयता और सटीकता भी एक मुद्दा है।[14][15] अन्य आलोचनाओं के अनुसार नकली या असत्यापित जानकारी का समावेश और विध्वंसक प्रवृति भी इसके दोष हैं,[16] हालाँकि विद्वानों के द्वारा किये गए कार्य बताते हैं कि विध्वंसक प्रवृति आमतौर पर अल्पकालिक होती है। 
[17][18] और एंड्रयू लिह ने ऑनलाइन पत्रकारिता पर पांचवीं अन्तर्राष्ट्रीय संगोष्ठी में,[19] विकिपीडिया के महत्त्व को न केवल एक विश्वकोश के सन्दर्भ में वर्णित किया बल्कि इसे एक बार बार अद्यतन होने वाले समाचार स्रोत के रूप में भी वर्णित किया क्योंकि यह हाल में हुई घटनाओं के बारे में बहुत जल्दी लेख प्रस्तुत करता है। जब टाइम पत्रिका ने यू (You) को वर्ष 2006 के लिए पर्सन ऑफ़ द इयर की मान्यता दी और बताया कि दुनिया भर में कई मिलियन उपयोगकर्ताओं के द्वारा इसका उपयोग किया जाता है और ऑनलाइन सहयोग में इसकी बढ़ती सफलता को मान्यता दी, इसने वेब 2.0 सेवाओ के तीन उदाहरणों में विकिपीडिया को यूट्यूब और माइस्पेस के साथ रखा। 
[20] विकिपीडिया, न्यूपीडिया (Nupedia) के लिए एक पूरक परियोजना के रूप में शुरू हुई, जो एक मुफ्त ऑनलाइन अंग्रेजी भाषा की विश्वकोश परियोजना है, जिसके लेखों को विशेषज्ञों के द्वारा लिखा गया और एक औपचारिक प्रक्रिया के तहत इसकी समीक्षा की गयी। न्यूपीडिया की स्थापना 9 मार्च 2000 को एक वेब पोर्टल कम्पनी बोमिस, इंक के स्वामित्व के तहत की गयी। इसके मुख्य सदस्य थे, जिम्मी वेल्स, बोमिस CEO और लेरी सेंगर, न्यूपीडिया के एडिटर-इन-चीफ और बाद के विकिपीडिया। 
प्रारंभ में न्यूपीडिया को इसके अपने न्यूपीडिया ओपन कंटेंट लाइसेंस के तहत लाइसेंस दिया गया और रिचर्ड स्टालमेन के सुझाव पर विकिपीडिया की स्थापना से पहले इसे GNU के मुफ्त डोक्युमेंटेशन लाइसेंस में बदल दिया गया। 
[21] लैरी सेंगर और जिम्मी वेल्स विकिपीडिया (Wikipedia) के संस्थापक हैं। [22][23] जहाँ एक ओर वेल्स को सार्वजनिक रूप से संपादन योग्य विश्वकोश के निर्माण के उद्देश्य को परिभाषित करने के श्रेय दिया जाता है,[24][25] सेंगर को आमतौर पर इस उद्देश्य को पूरा करने के लिए एक विकी की रणनीति का उपयोग करने का श्रेय दिया जाता है। [26] 10 जनवरी 2001 को, लेरी सेंगर ने न्यूपीडिया के लिए एक ""फीडर परियोजना"" के रूप में एक विकी का निर्माण करने के लिए न्यूपीडिया मेलिंग सूची की प्रस्तावना दी। 
[27]
विकिपीडिया को औपचारिक रूप से 15 जनवरी 2001 को, www.wikipedia.com पर एकमात्र अंग्रेजी भाषा के संस्करण के रूप में शुरू किया गया।[28] ओर इसकी घोषणा न्यूपीडिया मेलिंग सूची पर सेंगर के द्वारा की गयी। 
[24] विकिपीडिया की ""न्यूट्रल पॉइंट ऑफ़ व्यू""[29] की नीति को इसके प्रारंभिक महीनों में संकेतबद्ध किया गया, ओर यह न्यूपीडिया की प्रारंभिक ""पक्षपातहीन"" नीति के समान थी। 
अन्यथा, प्रारंभ में अपेक्षाकृत कम नियम थे और विकिपीडिया न्यूपीडिया से स्वतंत्र रूप से कार्य करती थी। [24] विकिपीडिया ने न्यूपीडिया से प्रारंभिक योगदानकर्ता प्राप्त किये, ये थे स्लेशडॉट पोस्टिंग और सर्च इंजन इंडेक्सिंग। 
2001 के अंत तक इसके लगभग 20,000 लेख और 18 भाषाओँ के संस्करण हो चुके थे। 2002 के अंत तक इसके 26 भाषाओँ के संस्करण हो गए, 2003 के अंत तक 46 और 2004 के अंतिम दिनों तक 161 भाषाओँ के संस्करण हो गए।[30] न्यूपीडिया और विकिपीडिया तब तक एक साथ उपस्थित थे जब पहले वाले के सर्वर को स्थायी रूप से 2003 में डाउन कर दिया गया और इसके पाठ्य को विकिपीडिया में डाल दिया गया। 
9 सितम्बर 2007 को अंग्रेजी विकिपीडिया 2 मिलियन लेख की संख्या को पार कर गया, यह तब तक का सबसे बड़ा संकलित विश्वकोश बन गया, यहाँ तक कि इसने योंगल विश्वकोश के रिकॉर्ड (1407) को भी तोड़ दिया, जिसने 600 वर्षों के लिए कायम रखा था। 
[31] एक कथित अंग्रेजी केन्द्रित विकिपीडिया में नियंत्रण की कमी और वाणिज्यिक विज्ञापन की आशंका से, स्पेनिश विकिपीडिया के उपयोगकर्ता फरवरी 2002 में Enciclopedia Libre के निर्माण के लिए विकिपीडिया से अलग हो गए।[32] बाद में उसी वर्ष, वेल्स ने घोषित किया कि विकिपीडिया विज्ञापनों का प्रदर्शन नहीं करेगा और इसकी वेबसाईट को wikipedia.org में स्थानांतरित कर दिया गया। [33] तब से कई अन्य परियोजनाओं को सम्पादकीय कारणों से विकिपीडिया से अलग किया गया है। विकिइन्फो के लिए किसी उदासीन दृष्टिकोण की आवश्यकता नहीं होती है और यह मूल अनुसंधान की अनुमति देता है। विकिपीडिया से प्रेरित नयी परियोजनाएं-जैसे सिटीजेंडियम (Citizendium), स्कॉलरपीडिया (Scholarpedia), कंजर्वापीडिया (Conservapedia) और गूगल्स नोल (Knol)[कृपया उद्धरण जोड़ें]-विकिपीडिया की कथित सीमाओं को संबोधित करने के लिए शुरू की गयी हैं, जैसे सहकर्मी समीक्षा, मूल अनुसंधान और वाणिज्यिक विज्ञापनपर इसकी नीतियां। विकिपीडिया फाउंडेशन का निर्माण 20 जून 2003 को विकिपीडिया और न्यूपीडिया से किया गया। [34] इसे 17 सितम्बर 2004 को विकिपीडिया को ट्रेडमार्क करने के लिए ट्रेडमार्क कार्यालय और अमेरिकी पेटेंट पर लागू किया गया। 
इस मार्क को 10 जनवरी 2006 को पंजीकरण का दर्जा दिया गया। 16 दिसम्बर 2004 को जापान के द्वारा ट्रेडमार्क संरक्षण उपलब्ध कराया गया और 20 जनवरी 2005 को यूरोपीय संघ के द्वारा ट्रेडमार्क संरक्षण उपलब्ध कराया गया। तकनीकी रूप से एक सर्विस मार्क, मार्क का स्कोप ""इंटरनेट के माध्यम से आम विश्वकोश के ज्ञान के क्षेत्र में जानकारी के प्रावधान"" के लिए है,[कृपया उद्धरण जोड़ें] कुछ उत्पादों जैसे पुस्तकों और DVDs के लिए विकिपीडिया ट्रेडमार्क के उपयोग को लाइसेंस देने की योजनायें बनायी जा रही हैं।

पारंपरिक विश्वकोशों जैसे एन्साइक्लोपीडिया ब्रिटेनिका (Encyclopædia Britannica) के विपरीत, विकिपीडिया के लेख किसी औपचारिक सहकर्मी समीक्षा की प्रक्रिया से होकर नहीं गुजरते हैं और लेख में परिवर्तन तुंरत उपलब्ध हो जाते हैं l
किसी भी लेख पर इसके निर्माता या किसी अन्य संपादक का अधिकार नहीं है और न ही किसी मान्यता प्राप्त प्राधिकरण के द्वारा इसका निरीक्षण किया जा सकता है। कुछ ही ऐसे विध्वंस-प्रवण पेज हैं जिन्हें केवल इनके स्थापित उपयोगकर्ताओं के द्वारा ही संपादित किया जा सकता है, या विशेष मामलों में केवल प्रशासकों के द्वारा संपादित किया जा सकता है, हर लेख को गुमनाम रूप में या एक उपयोगकर्ता के अकाउंट के साथ संपादित किया जा सकता है, जबकि केवल पंजीकृत उपयोगकर्ता ही एक नया लेख बना सकते हैं (केवल अंग्रेजी संस्करण में)।
इसके परिणामस्वरूप, विकिपीडिया अपने अवयवों ""की वैद्यता की कोई गारंटी नहीं"" देता है। 
[36] एक सामान्य सन्दर्भ कार्य होने के कारण, विकिपीडिया में कुछ ऐसी सामग्री भी है जिसे विकिपीडिया के संपादकों सहित कुछ लोग[37] आक्रामक, आपत्तिजनक और अश्लील मानते हैं। [38] उदाहरण के लिए, 2008 में, विकिपीडिया, ने इस निति को ध्यान में रखते हुए, अपने अंग्रेजी संस्करण में, मुहम्मद के वर्णन को शामिल करने के खिलाफ एक एक ऑनलाइन याचिका को अस्वीकार कर दिया।
विकिपीडिया में राजनीतिक रूप से संवेदनशील सामग्री की उपस्थिति के कारण, पीपुल्स रिपब्लिक ऑफ चाइना ने इस वेबसाइट के कुछ भागों का उपयोग को प्रतिबंधित कर दिया।[39] (यह भी देखें: विकिपीडिया के IWF ब्लॉक) विकिपीडिया के अवयव फ्लोरिडा में कानून के अधीन हैं (विशेष कॉपीराईट कानून में), जहाँ विकिपीडिया के सर्वरों की मेजबानी की जाती है और कई सम्पादकीय नीतियां और दिशानिर्देश इस बात पर बल देते हैं कि विकिपीडिया एक विश्वकोश है। 
विकिपीडिया में प्रत्येक प्रविष्टि एक विषय के बारे में होनी चाहिए जो विश्वकोश से सम्बंधित है और इस प्रकार से शामिल किये जाने के योग्य है। एक विषय विश्वकोश से सम्बंधित समझा जा सकता है यदि यह विकिपीडिया के शब्दजाल में ""उल्लेखनीय"" है,[40] अर्थात, यदि इसने उन माध्यमिक विश्वसनीय स्रोतों में महत्वपूर्ण कवरेज़ प्राप्त किया है (अर्थात मुख्यधारा मीडिया या मुख्य अकादमिक जर्नल), जो इस विषय के मामले से स्वतंत्र हैं। दूसरा, विकिपीडिया को केवल उसी ज्ञान को प्रदर्शित करना है जो पहले से ही स्थापित और मान्यता प्राप्त है।[41] दूसरे शब्दों में, उदाहरण के लिए इसे नयी जानकारी और मूल कार्य को प्रस्तुत नहीं करना चाहिए। एक दावा जिसे चुनौती दी जा सकती है, उसे विश्वसनीय सूत्रों के सन्दर्भ की आवश्यकता होती है। विकिपीडिया समुदाय के भीतर, इसे अक्सर ""verifiability, not truth"" के रूप में बताया जाता है, यह इस विचार को व्यक्त करता है कि पाठक खुद लेख में प्रस्तुत होने वाली सामग्री की सच्चाई की जांच कर सकें और इस विषय में अपनी खुद की व्याख्या बनायें.",Hindi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[42] अंत में, विकिपीडिया एक पक्ष नहीं लेता है।[43] सभी विचार और दृष्टिकोण, यदि बाहरी स्रोतों को निर्दिष्ट कर सकते हैं, उन्हें एक लेख के भीतर कवरेज़ का उपयुक्त हिस्सा मिलना चाहिए। [44] विकिपीडिया के संपादक एक समुदाय के रूप में उन नीतियों और दिशानिर्देशों को लिखते हैं और संशोधित करते हैं,[45] और उन्हें डिलीट करके उन पर बल देते हैं, टैग लगा कर उनकी व्याख्या करते हैं, या लेख की उस सामग्री में संशोधन करते हैं जो उसकी जरूरतों को पूरा करने में असफल होती हैं। 
(डीलीट करना और शामिल करना भी देखें)[46][47] योगदानकर्ता, चाहे वे पंजीकृत हों या नहीं, सॉफ्टवेयर में उपलब्ध उन सुविधाओं का लाभ उठा सकते हैं, जो विकिपीडिया को प्रबल बनाती हैं। 
प्रत्येक लेख से जुड़ा ""इतिहास"" का पृष्ठ लेख के प्रत्येक पिछले दोहरान का रिकॉर्ड रखता है, हालाँकि अभियोगपत्र के अवयवों, आपराधिक धमकी या कॉपीराइट के उल्लंघन के दोहरान को बाद में हटाया जा सकता है।
[48][49] यह सुविधा पुराने और नए संस्करणों की तुलना को आसान बनाती है, उन परिवर्तनों को अन्डू करने में मदद करती है जो संपादक को अनावश्यक लगते हैं, या खोये हुए अवयवों को रीस्टोर करने में भी मदद करती है। प्रत्येक लेख से सम्बंधित ""डिस्कशन (चर्चा)"" के पृष्ठ कई संपादकों के बीच कार्य का समन्वय करने के लिए प्रयुक्त किये जाते हैं।
[50] नियमित योगदानकर्ता अक्सर, अपनी रूचि के लेखों की एक ""वॉचलिस्ट"" बना कर रखते हैं, ताकि वे उन लेखों में हाल ही में हुए सभी परिवर्तनों पर आसानी से टैब्स रख सकें.",Hindi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"बोट्स नामक कंप्यूटर प्रोग्राम के निर्माण के बाद से ही इसका प्रयोग व्यापक रूप से विध्वंस प्रवृति को हटाने के लिए किया जाता रहा है,[18] इसका प्रयोग गलत वर्तनी और शैलीगत मुद्दों को सही करने के लिए और सांख्यिकीय आंकडों से मानक प्रारूप में भूगोल की प्रविष्टियों जैसे लेख को शुरू करने के लिए किया जाता है। संपादन मॉडल का खुला स्वभाव विकिपीडिया के अधिकांश आलोचकों के लिए केंद्र बना रहा है। 
उदाहरण के लिए, किसी भी अवसर पर, एक लेख का पाठक यह सुनिश्चित नहीं कर सकता कि जिस लेख को वह पढ़ रहा है उसमें विध्वंस प्रवृति शामिल है या नहीं। आलोचक तर्क देते हैं कि गैर विशेषज्ञ सम्पादन गुणवत्ता को कम कर देता है। क्योंकि योगदानकर्ता आम तौर पर पूरे दोहरान के बजाय एक प्रविष्टि के छोटे हिस्से को पुनः लिखते हैं, एक प्रविष्टि में उच्च और निम्न गुणवत्ता के अवयव परस्पर मिश्रित हो सकते हैं। 
इतिहासकार रॉय रोजेनजवीग ने कहा: ""कुल मिलाकर, लेखन विकिपीडिया का कमजोर आधार है। समितियां कभी कभी अच्छा लिखती हैं और विकिपीडिया की प्रविष्टियों की गुणवत्ता अक्सर अस्थिर होती है जो भिन्न लोगों के द्वारा लिखे गए वाक्यों या प्रकरणों के परस्पर मिलने का परिणाम होती हैं। ""
[51] ये सभी सटीक सूचना के एक स्रोत के रूप में विकिपीडिया की विश्वसनीयता पर सवाल पैदा करते हैं। 2008 में, दो शोधकर्ताओं ने सिद्धांत दिया कि विकिपीडिया का विकास सतत है।
[52] विकिपीडिया पर व्यवस्थित पूर्वाग्रह और असंगति प्रदर्शित करने का आरोप लगाया गया है;[15] आलोचकों का तर्क है कि अधिकांश जानकारी के लिए उपयुक्त स्रोतों की कमी और विकिपीडिया का खुला स्वभाव इसे अविश्वसनीय बनाता है। 
[53] कुछ टिप्पणीकारों का सुझाव है कि विकिपीडिया आमतौर पर विश्वसनीय है, लेकिन किसी भी दिए गए लेख की विश्वसनीयता हमेशा स्पष्ट नहीं होती है।[13] पारंपरिक सन्दर्भ कार्य जैसे एन्साइक्लोपीडिया ब्रिटेनिका (Encyclopædia Britannica) के सम्पादक, एक विश्वकोश के रूप में परियोजना की उपयोगिता और प्रतिष्ठा पर सवाल उठाते हैं। [54] विश्वविद्यालयों के कई प्रवक्ता अकादमिक कार्य में किसी भी एनसाइक्लोपीडिया, का प्राथमिक स्रोत के रूप में उपयोग करने से छात्रों को हतोत्साहित करते हैं;[55] कुछ तो विशेष रूप से विकिपीडिया के उपयोग को निषिद्ध करते हैं।[56] सह संस्थापक जिमी वेल्स इस बात पर ज़ोर देते है कि किसी भी प्रकार का विश्वकोश आमतौर पर प्राथमिक स्रोत के रूप में उपयुक्त नहीं हैं और प्राधिकृत के रूप से इस पर भरोसा नहीं किया जाना चाहिए।[57] उपयोगकर्ताओं की गोपनीयता के परिणामस्वरूप लेखे-जोखे की क्षमता की कमी के सम्बन्ध में भी मुद्दे उठाये गए हैं,[58] साथ ही कृत्रिम सूचना की प्रविष्टि, विध्वंस प्रवृति और इसी तरह की अन्य समस्याएं भी सामने आयी हैं।

"[60] कुछ आलोचकों का दावा है कि विकिपीडिया की खुली सरंचना के कारण इंटरनेट उत्पीड़क, विज्ञापनदाता और वे लोग जो कोई हमला बोलना चाहते हैं, इसे आसानी से लक्ष्य बनाते हैं।[48][61]अमेरिकी प्रतिनिधि सभा और विशेष हित के समूहों सहित संगठनों के द्वारा दिए गए लेखों में राजनितिक परिप्रेक्ष्य[16] शामिल किया गया है,[62] और संगठन जैसे माइक्रोसोफ्ट ने विशेष लेखों पर काम करने के लिए वित्तीय भत्ते देने का प्रस्ताव रखा है।[63] इन मुद्दों को मुख्य रूप से कोलबर्ट रिपोर्ट में स्टीफन कोलबर्ट के द्वारा ख़राब तरीके से प्रस्तुत किया गया है। [64] 2009 की पुस्तक द विकिपीडिया रेवोलुशन के लेखक एंड्रयू लिह के अनुसार, ""एक विकी में इसकी सभी गतिविधियाँ खुले में होती हैं ताकि इनकी जांच की जा सके...... समुदाय में अन्य लोगों की क्रियाओं के प्रेक्षण के द्वारा भरोसा पैदा किया जाता है, इसके लिए लोगों की सामान और पूरक रुचियों का पता लगाया जाता है।"" [65] अर्थशास्त्री टायलर कोवेन लिखते हैं, ""यदि मुझे यह सोचना पड़े कि अर्थशास्त्र पर विकिपीडिया के जर्नल लेख सच हैं या या मीडियन सम्बन्धी लेख सच हैं, तो मैं विकिपीडिया को चुनूंगा, इसके लिए मुझे ज्यादा सोचना नहीं पडेगा.""",Hindi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

हालाँकि, वे यह चेतावनी भी देते हैं कि इंटरनेट की साइटों पर त्रुटियां अक्सर पायी जाती हैं और शिक्षाविदों तथा विशेषज्ञों को इन्हें सुधारने के लिए सतर्क रहना चाहिए, 
[66] फ़रवरी 2007 में, द हार्वर्ड क्रिमसन अखबार में एक लेख में कहा गया कि हार्वर्ड विश्वविद्यालय में कुछ प्रोफेसर अपने पाठ्यक्रम में विकिपीडिया को शामिल करते हैं, लेकिन विकिपीडिया का उपयोग करने में उनकी अवधारणा में मतभेद है। 
[67] जून 2007 में अमेरिकी लाइब्रेरी एसोसिएशन के भूतपूर्व अध्यक्ष माइकल गोर्मनने गूगल के साथ, विकिपीडिया को निंदन किया,[68] और कहा कि वे शिक्षाविद जो विकिपीडिया के उपयोग का समर्थन करते हैं ""बौद्धिक रूप से उस आहार विशेषज्ञ के समतुल्य हैं जो सब चीजों के साथ बिग मैक्स के निरंतर आहार की सलाह देते हैं।"" उन्होंने यह भी कहा कि ""बौद्धिक रूप से निष्क्रिय लोगों की एक पीढ़ी जो इन्टरनेट से आगे बढ़ने में असमर्थ है"", उसे विश्वविद्यालयों में उत्पन्न किया जा रहा है। उनकी शिकायत है कि वेब आधारित स्रोत उस अधिक दुर्लभ पाठ्य को सीखने से रोक रहे हैं जो या तो केवल दस्तावेजों में मिलता है या सबस्क्रिप्शन-ओनली (जिनमें सदस्यता ली जाती है) वेबसाइट्स पर मिलता है। 
इसी लेख में जेन्नी फ्राई (ऑक्सफ़ोर्ड इंटरनेट संस्थान में एक अनुसंधान साथी) ने विकिपीडिया की अकादमिक शिक्षा पर टिप्पणी दी कि: ""आप यह नहीं कह सकते हैं कि बच्चे बौद्धिक रूप से आलसी हैं क्योंकि वे इंटरनेट का उपयोग कर रहें हैं जबकि दूसरी ओर शिक्षाविद अपने अनुसंधान में सर्च इंजन का उपयोग कर रहे हैं। 
अंतर यह है कि उन्हें जो भी उन्हें प्राप्त हो रहा है, वह अधिकारिक है या नहीं और इसके बारे में जटिल होने का उन्हें अधिक अनुभव है। बच्चों को यह बताने की आवश्यकता है कि एक महत्वपूर्ण और उचित तरीके से इंटरनेट का उपयोग कैसे किया जाये। ""[68] विकिपीडिया समुदाय ने विकिपीडिया की विश्वसनीयता को सुधारने की कोशिश की है। अंग्रेजी भाषा के विकिपीडिया ने मूल्यांकन पैमाने की शुरुआत की जिससे लेख की गुणवत्ता की जांच की जाती है;[69] अन्य संस्करणों ने भी इसे अपना लिया है। अंग्रजी में लगभग 2500 लेख ""फीचर्ड आर्टिकल"" के दर्जे के उच्चतम रैंक तक पहुँचने के लिए मापदंडों के समुच्चय को पास कर चुके हैं;[70] ऐसे लेख अपने विषय में सम्पूर्ण और भली प्रकार से लिखा गया कवरेज़ उपलब्ध कराते हैं, जिन्हें कई सहकर्मी समीक्षा प्रकाशनों के द्वारा समर्थन प्राप्त है।[71] ज़र्मन विकिपीडिया, लेखों के ""स्थिर संस्करणों"" के रख रखाव की एक प्रणाली का परीक्षण कर रहा है,[72] ताकि यह एक पाठक को लेख के उन संस्करणों को देखने में मदद करे जो विशिष्ट समीक्षाओं से होकर गुजर चुके हैं। अन्य भाषाओँ के संस्करण इस ""ध्वजांकित संशोधन"" के प्रस्ताव को लागू करने के लिए एक सहमति तक नहीं पहुँचे हैं।[73][74] एक और प्रस्ताव यह है कि व्यक्तिगत विकिपीडिया योगदानकर्ताओं के लिए ""ट्रस्ट रेटिंग"" बनाने के लिए सॉफ्टवेयर का उपयोग और इन रेटिंग्स का उपयोग यह निर्धारित करने में करना कि कौन से परिवर्तन तुंरत दिखायी देंगे। 
[75] विकिपीडिया समुदाय ने ""a bureaucracy of sorts"" की स्थापना की है, जिसमें ""एक स्पष्ट सत्ता सरंचना शामिल है जो स्वयं सेवी प्रशासकों को सम्पादकीय नियंत्रण का अधिकार देती है। [76][77][78]
विकिपीडिया के समुदाय को ""पंथ की तरह (cult-like)"" के रूप में भी वर्णित किया गया है,[79] हालाँकि इसे हमेशा पूरी तरह से नकारात्मक अभिधान के साथ इस तरह से वर्णित नहीं किया गया है,[80] और अनुभवहीन उपयोगकर्ताओं को समायोजित करने की असफलता के लिए इसकी आलोचना की जाती है।[81] समुदाय में अच्छी प्रतिष्ठा के सम्पादक स्वयंसेवक स्टेवर्डशिप के कई स्तरों में से एक को चला सकते हैं; यह ""प्रशासक"" के साथ शुरू होता है,[82][83] विशेषाधिकृत उपयोगकर्ताओं का एक समूह जिसके पास पृष्ठों को डीलीट करने की क्षमता है, विध्वंस प्रवृति या सम्पादकीय विवादों की स्थिति में लेख में परिवर्तन को रोक (lock) देते हैं और उपयोगकर्ताओं के सम्पादन को अवरुद्ध कर देते हैं। 
नाम के अलावा, प्रशासक फैसला लेने में किसी भी विशेषाधिकार का उपयोग नहीं करते हैं; इसके बजाय वे अधिकतर उन लेखों के संपादन तक ही सीमित होते हैं, जिनमें परियोजना व्यापक प्रभाव होते हैं और इस प्रकार से ये सामान्य संपादकों को अनुमति नहीं देते हैं और उपयोगकर्ताओं को विघटनकारी संपादन (जैसे विध्वंस प्रवृति) के लिए प्रतिबंधित कर देते हैं। 
[84] चूंकि विकिपीडिया विश्वकोश निर्माण के अपरंपरागत मोडल के साथ विकसित होता है, ""विकिपीडिया को कौन लिखता है?""",Hindi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"यह परियोजना के बारे में बार बार, अक्सर अन्य वेब 2.0 परियोजनाओं जैसे डिग के सन्दर्भ में पूछे जाने वाले प्रश्नों में से एक बन गया है। 
[85] जिमी वेल्स ने एक बार तर्क किया कि केवल ""एक समुदाय... कुछ सौ स्वयंसेवकों का एक समर्पित समूह"" विकिपीडिया को बहुत अधिक योगदान देता है और इसलिए परियोजना ""किसी पारंपरिक संगठन से अधिक मिलती जुलती है"" 
वेल्स ने एक अध्ययन में पाया कि 50% से अधिक संपादन केवल .7% उपयोगकर्ताओं के द्वारा ही किये जाते हैं, (उस समय पर: 524 लोग) योगदान के मूल्यांकन की इस विधि पर बाद में आरोन सवार्त्ज़ ने विवाद उठाया उन्होंने नोट किया कि कई लेख जिन पर उन्होंने अध्ययन किया, उनके अवयवों के एक बड़े भाग में उपयोगकर्ताओं ने कम सम्पादन के साथ योगदान दिया था। 
[86] 2007 में डार्टमाउथ कॉलेज के शोधकर्ताओं ने अध्ययन में यह पाया कि ""विकिपीडिया के गुमनाम और विरले योगदानकर्ता.........ज्ञान के स्रोत के रूप में उतने ही विश्वसनीय हैं, जितने कि वे योगदानकर्ता जो साईट के साथ पंजीकरण करते हैं।"" 
[87]
हालाँकि कुछ योगदानकर्ता अपने क्षेत्र में प्राधिकारी हैं, विकिपीडिया के लिए यह आवश्यक है कि यहाँ तक कि उनके योगदानकर्ता को प्रकाशित और निरीक्षण के सूत्रों द्वारा समर्थन प्राप्त हो। परियोजना की योग्यता पर सहमति की प्राथमिकता को ""उत्कृष्ट-विरोधी"" के रूप में चिन्हित किया गया है।[11] अगस्त 2007 में, विर्गील ग्रिफ़िथ द्वारा विकसित एक वेबसाईट विकिस्केनर ने विकिपीडिया के खातों के बिना बेनाम संपादकों के द्वारा विकिपीडिया में किये जाने वाले परिवर्तन के स्रोतों का पता लगाना शुरू किया। 
इस कार्यक्रम ने प्रकट किया कि कई ऐसे संपादन निगमों या सरकारी एजेंसियों के द्वारा किये गए जिनमें उन से सम्बंधित, उनके कर्मचारियों या उनके कार्यों से सम्बंधित लेखों के अवयवों को बदला गया।[88] 2003 में एक समुदाय के रूप में विकिपीडिया के एक अध्ययन में, अर्थशास्त्र के पी.एच.डी.",Hindi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[110] यह जनमत संग्रह 9 अप्रैल से 30 अप्रैल तक किया गया।[111] परिणाम थे 75.8% ""हाँ"", 10.5% ""नहीं"" और 13.7% ""कोई राय नहीं""[112] इस जनमत संग्रह के परिणाम में, विकिमीडिया न्यासी मंडल ने क्रिएटिव कॉमन्स लाईसेन्स को, प्रभावी 15 जून 2009 से बदलने के लिए मतदान किया।[112] यह स्थिति कि विकिपीडिया सिर्फ एक मेजबान सेवा है, इसका उपयोग सफलतापूर्वक अदालत में एक बचाव के रूप में किया गया है।[113][114] मीडिया फ़ाइलों (उदाहरण छवि फ़ाइलें) की हेंडलिंग का तरीका भाषा संस्करण के अनुसार अलग अलग होता है। कुछ भाषा संस्करण जैसे अंग्रेजी विकिपीडिया में उचित उपयोग सिद्धांत के अर्न्तगत गैर मुफ्त छवि फाइलें शामिल हैं जबकि अन्य में ऐसा नहीं होता है। यह भिन्न देशों के बीच कॉपीराइट कानूनों में अंतर के कारण आंशिक है; उदाहरण के लिए, उचित उपयोग की धारणा जापानी कॉपीराइट कानून में मौजूद नहीं है। मुफ्त सामग्री लाइसेंस के द्वारा कवर की जाने वाली मिडिया फाइलें, (उदाहरण क्रिएटिव कोमन्स cc-by-sa) को विकिमीडिया कोमन्स रिपोजिटरी के माध्यम से भाषा संस्करणों में शेयर किया जाता है, यह विकिमीडिया फाउंडेशन द्वारा संचालित परियोजना है। वर्तमान में विकिपीडिया के 262 भाषा संस्करण हैं; इनमें से 24 भाषाओं में 100,000 से अधिक लेख है और 81 भाषाओं में 1,000 से अधिक लेख है।[1] एलेक्सा के अनुसार, अंग्रेजी उपडोमेन (en.wikipedia.org; अंग्रेजी विकिपीडिया) अन्य भाषाओँ में शेष विभाजन के साथ विकिपीडिया के कुल ट्रेफिक का 52% भाग प्राप्त करता है (स्पेनिश: 19%, फ्रेंच: 5%, पॉलिश: 3%, जर्मन: 3%, जापानी: 3%, पुर्तगाली: 2%).",Hindi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[3] जुलाई 2008 को, पांच सबसे बड़े भाषा संस्करण हैं (लेख गणना के क्रम में)- अंग्रेजी, जर्मन, फ्रेंच, पॉलिश और जापानी विकिपीडिया.",Hindi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[115] चूंकि विकिपीडिया वेब आधारित है और इसलिए पूरी दुनिया में समान भाषा संस्करण के योगदानकर्ता भिन्न बोलियों का प्रयोग कर सकते हैं या भिन्न देशों से आ सकते हैं (जैसा कि अंग्रेजी संस्करण के मामले में होता है) 
इन अंतरों के कारण वर्तनी अंतर (जैसे रंग बनाम रंग)[116] या दृष्टिकोण पर कुछ मतभेद हो सकते हैं। 
[117]
हालाँकि वैश्विक नीतियों जैसे ""न्यूट्रल पॉइंट ऑफ़ व्यू"" के लिए कई भाषाओँ के संस्करण हैं, वे नीति और अभ्यास के कुछ बिन्दुओं पर वितरित हो जाते हैं, सबसे विशेषकर उन छवियों पर जिन्हें मुफ्त लाइसेंस प्राप्त नहीं हुआ है, उनका उपयोग उचित उपयोग के एक दावे के अर्न्तगत किया जा सकता है। 
[118][119][120] जिमी वेल्स ने विकिपीडिया को इस प्रकार से वर्णित किया है, ""ग्रह पर हर एक व्यक्ति के लिए उनकी अपनी भाषा में उच्चतम संभव गुणवत्ता का एक मुफ्त विश्वकोश बनाने और वितरित करने का एक प्रयास""। 
[121] हालाँकि प्रत्येक भाषा संस्करण कम या अधिक स्वतंत्र रूप से कार्य करता है, उन सब पर निगरानी रखने के लिए कुछ प्रयास किये जाते हैं। 
वे आंशिक रूप से मेटा विकी के द्वारा समन्वित किये जाते हैं, विकिमीडिया फाउंडेशन का विकी इसकी सभी परियोजनाओं (विकिपीडिया और अन्य) के रख रखाव के लिए समर्पित है।
[122] उदाहरण के लिए, मेटा-विकी विकिपीडिया के सभी भाषा संस्करणों पर महत्वपूर्ण आंकडे उपलब्ध करता है,[123] और यह हर विकिपीडिया में आवश्यक लेखों की सूची रखता है।[124] यह सूची विषय के अनुसार मूल अवयवों से प्रसंग रखती है: जीवनी, इतिहास, भूगोल, समाज, संस्कृति, विज्ञान, प्रौद्योगिकी, खाद्य पदार्थ और गणित.",Hindi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"शेष के लिए, विशेष भाषा से सम्बंधित लेख के लिए अन्य संस्करणों में समकक्ष न होना दुर्लभ नहीं है। उदाहरण के लिए, संयुक्त राज्य अमेरिका में छोटे शहरों के बारे में लेख केवल अंग्रेजी में ही उपलब्ध हो सकते हैं। अनुवादित लेख अधिकांश संस्करणों में लेख के एक छोटे हिस्से का प्रतिनिधित्व करते हैं, क्योंकि लेखों के स्वचालित अनुवाद की अनुमति नहीं होती है। 
[125] एक से अधिक भाषा में उपलब्ध लेख ""इंटरविकी"" लिंक पेश कर सकते हैं, जो अन्य संस्करणों के समकक्ष लेखों से सम्बंधित होते हैं। विकिपीडिया लेखों के संग्रह ऑप्टिकल डिस्क्स पर प्रकाशित किया गया है। एक अंग्रेजी संस्करण, 2006 विकिपीडिया CD सलेक्शन में लगभग 2,000 लेख शामिल थे।[126][127] पॉलिश संस्करण में लगभग 240,000 लेख शामिल हैं।[128] जर्मन संस्करण भी उपलब्ध हैं।[129] अपने लेखों की संख्या में तार्किक विकास के अलावा,[130] 2001 में अपनी स्थापना के बाद से विकिपीडिया ने एक आम सन्दर्भ वेबसाइट के रूप में दर्जा प्राप्त किया है।[131] अलेक्सा और कॉमस्कोर के अनुसार, दुनिया भर में विकिपीडिया उन अग्रणी दस वेबसाईटों में है जिस पर लोग सबसे ज्यादा जाते हैं।[10][132] शीर्ष दस में से, विकिपीडिया ही एकमात्र गैर लाभ वेबसाइट है। गूगल खोज परिणामों में इसके प्रमुख स्थान द्वारा विकिपीडिया के विकास को प्रोत्साहित किया गया है;[133] विकिपीडिया में आने वाले सर्च इंजन ट्रेफिक का लगभग 50% गूगल से आता है,[134] जिसमें से एक बड़ा भाग अकादमिक अनुसंधान से संबंधित है।[135] अप्रैल 2007 में प्यू इन्टरनेट और अमेरिकन लाइफ परियोजना ने यह पाया कि एक तिहाई अमेरिकी इंटरनेट उपयोगकर्ता विकिपीडिया से सलाह लेते हैं।[136] अक्टूबर 2006 में, साइट का एक काल्पनिक खपत मूल्य अनुमानतः $ 580 मिलियन था, अगर साईट ने विज्ञापन चलाये.",Hindi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[137] विकिपीडिया के अवयवों को अकादमिक अध्ययन, पुस्क्तकों, सम्मेलनों और अदालत के मामले में प्रयुक्त किया गया है।[138][139][140]कनाडा की संसद की वेबसाइट में, सिविल विवाह अधिनियम के लिए, इसके ""आगे पठन"" की सूची के ""सम्बंधित लिंक्स"" सेक्शन में समान लिंग विवाह पर विकिपीडिया के लेख से सम्बन्ध रखती है।[141] विश्वकोश की स्वीकृतियों को संगठनों जैसे यू॰एस॰ फेडरल कोर्ट और विश्व बौद्धिक संपदा संगठन के द्वारा प्रयुक्त किया जाता है[142]- हालाँकि मुख्य रूप से इनका उपयोग मुख्य रूप से एक मामले के लिए जानकारी के फैसले से अधिक जानकारी के समर्थन के लिए होता है। [143] विकिपीडिया पर प्रकट होने वाले अवयव कुछ अमेरिकी खुफिया एजेंसीयों की रिपोर्ट में एक स्रोत के रूप में उद्धृत किये गए हैं। [144] दिसम्बर 2008 में वैज्ञानिक पत्रिका RNA बायोलोजी ने RNA अणुओं के वर्ग के वर्णन के लिए एक नया सेक्शन शुरू किया और इसे ऐसे लेखकों की जरुरत होती है जो विकिपीडिया में प्रकाशन के लिए RNA वर्ग पर एक ड्राफ्ट लेख लिखने में मदद करते हैं। [145] विकिपीडिया को पत्रकारिता में एक स्रोत के रूप में इस्तेमाल किया गया है,[146] कभी कभी बिना गुणधर्मों के ऐसा किया गया और कई पत्रकारों को विकिपीडिया से नक़ल करने के लिए बर्खास्त किया गया।[147][148][149]
जुलाई 2007 में, विकिपीडियाने बीबीसी रेडियो 4 पर 30 मिनट के एक वृत्तचित्र को प्रस्तुत किया,[150] जिसने तर्क दिया कि, उपयोगिता और जागरूकता के बढ़ने के साथ लोकप्रिय संस्कृति में विकिपीडिया के सन्दर्भ की संख्या इस प्रकार से है कि टर्म 21 वीं सदी की संज्ञाओं के एक चयन बैंड में से एक है जो बहुत लोकप्रिय हैं (गूगल, फेसबुक, यूट्यूब) कि वे उन्हने अधिक व्याख्या की जरुरत नहीं होती है और हूवरिंग और कोक की तरह 20 वीं सदी के टर्म्स के समतुल्य हैं। कई हास्यास्पद विकिपीडिया का खुलापन, ऑनलाइन विश्वकोश परियोजना लेखों के संशोधन या विध्वंस प्रवृति के पात्रों को दर्शाता हैं। 
विशेष रूप से, हास्य अभिनेता स्टीफन कोल्बेर्ट ने अपने शो द कोलबर्ट रिपोर्ट के असंख्य प्रकरणों में विकिपीडिया किए हास्य का प्रयोग किया है और इसके लिए एक शब्द दिया ""विकिअलिटी"".",Hindi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[64] इस साइटने मीडिया के कई रूपों पर एक प्रभाव पैदा किया है। कुछ मीडिया स्रोत त्रुटियों के लिए विकिपीडिया की संवेदनशीलता पर व्यंग्य करते हैं, जैसे जुलाई 2006 में द अनियन में मुख पृष्ठ का लेख जिसका शीर्षक था ""विकिपीडिया सेलेब्रेट्स 750 इयर्स ऑफ़ अमेरिकन इंडीपेनडेंस.""",Hindi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[151] अन्य विकिपीडिया के बारे में कहते हैं कि कोई भी संपादन कर सकता है जैसे द ऑफिस के एक प्रकरण ""द नेगोशिएशन"", जिसमें पात्र माइकल स्कॉट ने कहा, ""विकिपीडिया एक सबसे अच्छी चीज है"".",Hindi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"इस दुनिया में कोई भी किसी भी विषय के बारे में कुछ भी लिख सकता है, इसलिए आप जानते हैं कि आपको सर्वोत्तम संभव जानकारी मिल रही है।"" कुछ चयनित विकिपीडिया की नीतियों जैसे xkcd स्ट्रिप को ""विकिपिडियन प्रोटेस्टर"" नाम दिया गया है। अप्रैल 2008 में डच फिल्म निर्माता एईजेसब्रांड वॉन वीलेन ने अपने 45 मिनट के टेलीविजन वृत्तचित्र ""द ट्रुथ अकार्डिंग टु विकिपीडिया"" का प्रसारण किया।[152] विकिपीडिया के बारे में एक और वृत्तचित्र शीर्षक "" ट्रुथ इन नंबर्स: द विकिपीडिया स्टोरी"" 2009 प्रदर्शन के लिए निर्धारित है। कई महाद्वीपों पर शूट की गयी, यह फिल्म विकिपीडिया के इतिहास और दुनिया भर में विकिपीडिया के संपादकों के साथ किये गए साक्षात्कारों को कवर करेगी। [153][154] 28 सितंबर 2007 को, इतालवी राजनीतिज्ञ फ्रेंको ग्रिल्लिनी ने चित्रमाला की स्वतंत्रता की आवश्यकता के बारे में सांस्कृतिक संसाधन और गतिविधियों के मंत्री के सम्नाक्ष संसदीय प्रश्न उठाया। उन्होंने कहा कि ऐसी आजादी की कमी विकिपीडिया पर दबाव बनाती है,"" जो सातवीं ऐसी वेबसाईट है जिस पर लोग विजित करते हैं"" यह आधुनिक इतालवी इमारतों और कला की सभी छवियों पर रोक लगाती है और दावा किया कि इसने पर्यटन राजस्व को बेहद क्षति पहुँचायी है। 
[155] 16 सितंबर 2007 को द वाशिंगटन पोस्ट ने सूचना दी कि विकिपीडिया 2008 अमेरिकी चुनाव अभियान में एक केंद्र बिन्दु बन गया, इसके अनुसार ""जब आप गूगल में उम्मीदवार का नाम टाइप करते हैं, एक विकिपीडिया पृष्ठ ही पहला परिणाम होता है, यह इन प्रविष्टियों को उतना ही महत्वपूर्ण बनता है जितना कि एक उम्मीदवार को परिभाषित करना.",Hindi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"पहले से ही, राष्ट्रपति प्रविष्टियों को प्रतिदिन अनगिनत बार संपादित, अवलोकित किया जा रहा है और इस पर विचार-विमर्श किया जा रहा है।"" [156] अक्टूबर 2007 के रायटर्स लेख शीर्षक ""विकिपीडिया पेज द लेटेस्ट स्टेटस सिम्बल"" में इस घटना पर रिपोर्ट दी गयी कि कैसे एक विकिपीडिया लेख किसी की विख्याति को साबित करता है।[157] विकिपीडिया ने मई 2004 में दो प्रमुख पुरस्कार जीते। [158] पहला था, वार्षिक प्रिक्स अर्स इलेक्ट्रोनिका प्रतियोगिता में गोल्डन निका फॉर डिजीटल कमयूनिटीस; यह पुरस्कार € 10000 (£ 6588; $ 12,700) अनुदान के साथ आया था और इसके साथ ऑस्ट्रिया में पी ए ई सइबरआर्ट्स समारोह में उस वर्ष दस्तावेज़ करने के लिए एक निमंत्रण भी प्राप्त किया गया था। 
दूसरा, ""समुदाय"" श्रेणी के लिए में न्यायाधीशों का वेब्बी अवार्ड था।[159] विकिपीडिया को ""बेस्ट प्रक्टिसस"" वेब्बी के लिए मनोनीत किया गया। 26 जनवरी 2007 को, विकिपीडिया को ब्रांडचैनल.कॉम के पाठकों द्वारा सर्वोत्तम चौथी ब्रांड श्रेणी से सम्मानित किया गया था; ""किस ब्रांड ने 2006 में हमारे जीवन पर सर्वाधिक प्रभाव डाला"" सवाल के जवाब में 15% मतदान प्राप्त किया गया।[160] सितम्बर 2008 में, विकिपीडिया ने बोरिस टाडिक, एकार्ट होफ्लिंग और पीटर गेब्रियल के साथ वेर्कस्टाट डॉइशलैंड का क्वाडि्ृगा अ मिशन ऑफ़ एनलाइटएनमेंट पुरस्कार प्राप्त किया। यह पुरस्कार जिमी वेल्स को डेविड वेंबेर्गेर द्वारा पेश किया गया।[161] जनता द्वारा लिखित इंटरैक्टिव मल्टीमीडिया विश्वकोश की असंख्य प्रविष्टियाॅं, विकिपीडिया की स्थापना से भी लंबे (लम्बे) समय पहले मौजूद थीं। इनमें से पहला था 1986 BBC डोमस्डे प्रोजेक्ट, जिसमें ब्रिटेन के 1 मिलियन से अधिक योगदानकर्ताओं के पाठ्य (BBC माइक्रो कंप्यूटर पर प्रविष्ट) और तस्वीरें शामिल थीं और यह ब्रिटेन के भूगोल, कला और संस्कृति को कवर करता था। यह पहला इंटरैक्टिव मल्टीमीडिया विश्वकोश था (और साथ ही आंतरिक लिंक्स के माध्यम से जुड़ा पहला मुख्य मल्टीमीडिया दस्तावेज़ भी था), इसमें अधिकांश लेख ब्रिटेन के एक इंटरेक्टिव मानचित्र के माध्यम से उपलब्ध थे। उपयोगकर्ता इंटरफ़ेस और डोमस्डे प्रोजेक्ट के अवयवों के एक हिस्से को अब एक वेबसाईट पर डाल दिया गया है। [162] सबसे सफल प्रारंभिक ऑनलाइन विश्वकोशों में से एक था h2g2 जिस पर जनता के द्वारा प्रविष्टियाँ की जाती थीं, जिसे डगलस एडम्स के द्वारा निर्मित किया गया और इसे BBC के द्वारा चलाया जाता है। h2g2 विश्वकोश तुलनात्मक रूप से हल्का फुल्का था, यह उन लेखों पर ध्यान केन्द्रित करता था जो हास्यपूर्ण भी हों और जानकारीपूर्ण भी हों।
इन दोनों परियोजनाओं में विकिपीडिया के साथ समानता थी, लेकिन दोंनों में से किसी ने भी सार्वजनिक उपयोगकर्ताओं को पूर्ण संपादकीय स्वतंत्रता नहीं दी। ऐसी ही एक गैर-विकी परियोजना GNU पीडिया परियोजना, अपने इतिहास के आरम्भ में न्यूपीडिया के साथ उपस्थित थी; हालाँकि इसे सेवानिवृत्त कर दिया गया है और इसके निर्माता मुफ्त सॉफ्टवेयर व्यक्ति रिचर्ड स्टालमेन ने विकिपीडिया को समर्थन दिया है। 
[21] विकिपीडिया ने कई सम्बन्धी परियोजनाओं का सूत्रपात भी किया है, इन्हें भी विकिमीडिया फाउंडेशन द्वारा संचालित किया जाता है। पहला, ""इन मेमोरियम: सितंबर 11 विकी"",[163] अक्टूबर 2002 में निर्मित,[164] जो 11 सितंबर के हमलों को विस्तृत किया; इस परियोजना को अक्टूबर 2006 में बंद कर दिया गया था। विकटियोनरी, एक शब्दकोश परियोजना, दिसंबर 2002 में शुरू की गई थी;[165] विकिकोट कोटेशन्स का एक संग्रह, जो विकिमीडिया के उदघाटन के एक सप्ताह बाद शुरू हुआ और विकिबुक्स सहयोग से लिखी गयी मुफ्त पुस्तकों का एक संग्रह.",Hindi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"तब से विकिमीडिया ने कई अन्य परियोजनाएं शुरू की हैं, इसमें विकीवर्सिटी भी शामिल है, यह मुफ्त अध्ययन सामग्री के निर्माण के लिए और ऑनलाइन शिक्षण गतिविधियों का प्रावधान करने की परियोजना है। 
[166] हालाँकि, इन में से कोई भी सम्बंधित परियोजना, विकिपीडिया की सफलता प्राप्ति में सहायक नहीं रही है। विकिपीडिया की जानकारी के कुछ उपसमुच्चय अक्सर विशिष्ट उद्देश्य के लिए अतिरिक्त समीक्षा के साथ विकसित किये गए हैं। उदाहरण के लिए, विकिपीडीयन्स और SOS बच्चों के द्वारा निर्मित CD /DVD की विकिपीडिया श्रृंखला (उर्फ ""विकिपीडिया फॉर स्कूल्स""), एक मुफ्त, हाथ से जांच की गयी, विकिपीडिया से गैर वाणिज्यिक चुनाव है, जो ब्रिटेन के राष्ट्रीय पाठ्यक्रम में लक्षित है और अधिकांश अंग्रेजी भाषी दुनिया के लिए उपयोगी है। 
विकिपीडिया फॉर स्कूल्स ऑनलाइन उपलब्ध है: एक समकक्ष प्रिंट विश्वकोश के लिए लगभग बीस संस्करणों की आवश्यकता होगी।
ये विकिपीडिया के लेख के एक सलेक्ट सबसेट को एक मुद्रित पुस्तक रूप देने का प्रयास भी किया गया है।
[167] सहयोगी ज्ञान आधार विकास पर केन्द्रित अन्य वेबसाईटों ने या तो विकिपीडिया से प्रेरणा प्राप्त की है या उसे प्रेरित किया है।
कुछ, जैसे सुस्निंग.नु (Susning.nu), एनसिक्लोपेडिया लीब्रे (Enciclopedia Libre) और विकिज़नानी (WikiZnanie) किसी औपचारिक समीक्षा प्रक्रिया का इस्तेमाल नहीं करते है, जबकि अन्य जैसे एनसाइक्लोपीडिया ऑफ़ लाइफ (Encyclopedia of Life), स्टैनफोर्ड एनसाइक्लोपीडिया ऑफ़ फिलोसोफी (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy), स्कोलरपीडिया (Scholarpedia), h2g2, एव्रीथिंग2 (Everything2), अधिक पारंपरिक सहकर्मी समीक्षा का उपयोग करते है। एक ऑनलाइन विश्वकोश, सिटिज़नडियम को विकिपीडिया के सह-संस्थापक लैरी सेंगर के द्वारा विकिपीडिया के ""विशेषज्ञ अनुकूल"" का निर्माण करने के प्रयास में शुरू किया गया था।[168][169][170] निर्देशांक: 37°47′13″N 122°23′59″W﻿ / ﻿37.78697°N 122.399677°W﻿ / 37.78697; -122.399677 विकिमीडिया संस्थान एक अमेरिकी गैर-लाभकारी संस्थान है, जिसका मुख्यालय सैन फ्रांसिस्को, कैलिफोर्निया में स्थित है। इसकी स्थापना जिमी वेल्स ने 20 जून 2003 को की थी। यह दान में प्राप्त पैसों से संचालित होता है। इस संस्थान की सबसे अधिक प्रसिद्ध परियोजना विकिपीडिया है। इसके अलावा भी कई अन्य परियोजनाओं को शुरू किया गया था। जिसमें विक्षनरी (शब्दकोश), विकिस्रोत, विकिसमाचार, विकिसूक्ति, विकिपुस्तक, विकियात्रा आदि हैं। इसके अलावा कई ऐसे प्रकल्प भी है, जिसमें सभी भाषाओं के सदस्य योगदान देते हैं। इसमें मेटा विकि, इनक्यूबेटर, कॉमन्स आदि हैं। विकिमीडिया संस्थान का उद्देश्य मुफ्त लाइसेंस या सार्वजनिक कार्यक्रम (public domain) के अन्तर्गत, शैक्षणिक सामग्री एकत्रित करके विश्व के लोगों को सशक्त एवं व्यस्त बनाना, एवं इसे भूमण्डल में प्रभाविकता से प्रसारित करना है। अध्यायों के अन्तरजाल की सहायता से, संस्थान एक से अधिक भाषा के लिये विकि प्रोजेक्ट एवं अन्य प्रयत्न, जो कि उद्देश्य की और अग्रसर है, की सहायता एवं विकास के लिये मूलभूत और संगठित ढांचा प्रदान करता है। संस्थान इन प्रॉजेक्ट्स की मदद से निरन्तर इंटरनेट पर मुफ्त उपयोगी सूचना उपलब्ध करायेगा। विकिमीडिया फ्लोरिडा, अमेरिका के कानून के अंतर्गत एक बिना-लाभार्जन की दानपुण्य संस्था है। पूरी तरह से हिसाब रखने वाला विकिमीडिया संस्थान गाइडस्टार एवं इसकी भागीदार साइटों पर एक दानपुण्य संस्था के रूप में सूचित है। विकिमिडिया संस्थान अमेरिका में ५०१(सी)(३) कर-मुक्त स्थिति में है। विकिमीडिया संस्थान प्रसिद्ध कार्यकारी एनसायक्लोपीडिया, विकिपीडिया, २००६ के अंत तक विश्व में सबसे ज्यादा देखी जाने वाली १५ वेबसाइटों में से एक, को सहयोग देता है। जनवरी, २००१ में विकिपीडिया की स्थापना, एवं जून, २००३ में विकिमीडिया संस्थान की समविष्टि से इसकी प्रगति विस्मयित रही है। अंग्रेजी-भाषा विकिपीडिया, इसका प्रथम कार्यक्रम, समाविष्टि के बाद से १.३५ लाख लेखों से आज १५० लाख लेख तक पहुँच गया है। ३९ अन्य-भाषाओं की विकिपीडिया पर अपनी भाषा में १००,००० से ज्यादा लेख लिखे जा चुके हैं। साथ ही साथ, संस्थान विकिपीडिया के अतिरिक्त, अन्य कई प्रोजेक्टों को संचालित करता है, जैसे कि विकिमीडिया कोमन्स, मुफ्त चित्रों एवं मीडिया का संग्रहण, जिसने नवंबर २००६ में दस लाख चित्रों का आंकडा पार किया है। विक्शनरी, मुफ्त शब्दकोष, ८ अलग-अलग भाषाओं में ५०,००० शब्दों से ज्यादा प्रविष्टियां रखता है, जिनमें से तीन २००,००० से ज्यादा परिभाषायें रखते हैं। विकिसोर्स, एक भौतिक स्रोत संग्रहण, लगभग १५०,००० पृष्टों का संग्रहण है। विकिकोटे (उद्धरण), विकिबुक्स (आपसी सहयोग से लिखी पुस्तकें), विकिन्यूज (नगरीय समाचार पत्र), विकिवर्सिटी (पाठ्यक्रम विकास), ये सब उसी रफ्तार से अग्रसर है। कुल मिलाकर, इन कार्यक्रम में ७८ लाख से अधिक पृष्ट, २२ लाख से अधिक चित्र, एवं ५० लाख से अधिक पंजीकृत खाते हैं। विकिट्रेवल, ओमेगाविकि, एवं विकिआ, संस्थान के द्वारा संचालित कार्यक्रम नहीं है। अंग्रेज़ी (w)  · सेबुआनो (w)  ·

.हम सभी अंग्रेजी में और अधिक धाराप्रवाह बनने के त्वरित तरीकों की तलाश कर रहे हैं, मुझे पता है कि मुझे पता है कि क्या होता है कि हमारे मस्तिष्क को चक्कर लगाने वाले कुछ शब्द हैं और हमें इस पूरी बातचीत को केवल अद्भुत अद्भुत शांत या महाकाव्य का उपयोग करने की आवश्यकता है ताकि हम कैसे हो कुछ नए नए अंग्रेजी शब्द सीखें जिन्हें आप अपने दैनिक जीवन में उपयोग कर सकते हैं और अपनी शब्दावली मिनटों में बढ़ा सकते हैं। तो आज हम 10 नए स्मार्ट शब्दों को सीखने के लिए जा रहे हैं उनके अर्थ मूल शब्द और उदाहरण वाक्य ताकि हम जा रहे हैं अरे यह सब हो रहा है और आप देख रहे हैं। और इस वीडियो में मैं आपको दैनिक उपयोग के लिए और इस वीडियो के अंत में 10 स्मार्ट शब्द देने जा रहा हूं। मैं भी आपको वास्तव में धाराप्रवाह स्मार्ट शब्द संख्या ध्वनि करने के लिए एक स्मार्ट टिप देने जा रहा हूं। एक दलित दलदल में बह जाने का मतलब है डूबना या बाढ़ आना लेकिन दलदल का इस्तेमाल अक्सर काम के संदर्भ में किया जाता है जैसे कि ' काम के साथ मैं बहुत ज्यादा काम करने के लिए तैयार हूँ, मुझे इस पूरे हफ्ते काम के साथ दलदली होना पड़ा है और मुश्किल से सांस लेने का समय मिला है अब इस शब्द की जड़ को देखते हैं। दलदल आर्द्रभूमि का एक टुकड़ा है और अगर कोई दलदल में गलत जगह पर कदम रखता है तो वे आसानी से डूब सकते हैं और दलदल का क्रिया रूप डूबने का मतलब है कि यहां आप इस शब्द का उपयोग कैसे कर सकते हैं। मान लीजिए कि आपके पास बहुत सारे असाइनमेंट हैं और आपके पास एक परीक्षा आ रही है और आपके मित्र आपके पास आते हैं और वे कहते हैं। अरे, आप हमारे साथ क्यों नहीं घूमते हैं, आप उनसे कह सकते हैं कि मुझे बहुत खेद है, लेकिन मैं काम से बह गया हूं या मैंने कुछ अन्य शब्दों को स्वाहा कर दिया है, जिनका उपयोग आप दलदली के स्थान पर कर सकते हैं, मुझे बहुत अधिक मिला है ऐसा करने के लिए। मेरी प्लेट पर बहुत अधिक है मैं काम में डूब रहा हूं। मैं असाइनमेंट के साथ बहक गया हूँ स्मार्ट शब्द नंबर दो को पकड़ना है -22 अब मुझे यकीन है ' इस शब्द को कैच -22 से पहले सुना है, इसका मतलब एक असंभव स्थिति है जिसमें आप एक काम नहीं कर सकते हैं जब तक कि आपने दूसरे को नहीं किया है और आप दूसरे को नहीं कर सकते क्योंकि आपने पहले नहीं किया है। मैंने आपको भ्रमित किया है ताकि मैं आपको कुछ उदाहरण दे सकूं, जब आपको कार्य अनुभव के बिना नौकरी नहीं मिलती है, तो यह एक स्थिति है। लेकिन आप अनुभव प्राप्त नहीं कर सकते हैं जब तक कि आप एक नौकरी पकड़ने -22 प्राप्त नहीं करते हैं, जोसेफ हेलर द्वारा उसी नाम कैच -22 की अपनी प्रसिद्ध पुस्तक में गढ़ा गया था जब वह कुछ विरोधाभासी नियमों का वर्णन कर रहे थे जो विश्व युद्ध दो के दौरान सैनिकों पर लागू थे। कैच -22 का एक और उदाहरण आपको बैंक ऋण की आवश्यकता है क्योंकि आपके पास पर्याप्त नहीं है। जब तक आप बैंक को यह साबित नहीं कर देते कि आपके पास पर्याप्त पैसा है, तब तक आपको वह बैंक ऋण नहीं मिलेगा, अगली बार जब आप मुश्किल स्थिति में फंसेंगे तो याद रखें। शब्द -22 का उपयोग करने के लिए। और इन प्रशंसात्मक शब्दों को अपने दोस्तों के दूसरे शब्दों से प्राप्त करें जिन्हें आप कैच -22 के स्थान पर उपयोग कर सकते हैं वे विरोधाभास या दुविधा वाले स्मार्ट शब्द हैं। नंबर तीन है सवेव सवेव का अर्थ है विनम्र शांत और परिष्कृत होने के लिए परिष्कृत होना। सुविचारित शब्द सुवे के कई अलग-अलग मूल हैं लेकिन शब्द का एक बहुत ही रोचक मूल है जिसका अर्थ है सुखद या मीठा स्वाद। वह विशेष रूप से महिलाओं या बराक ओबामा के सामने इतनी मार्मिक और सुसाइड करने वाली है कि अब अगली बार किसी पार्टी में जाने पर उसे याद रखना बहुत आसान और पॉलिश है और आप इस व्यक्ति को देखते हैं। सुव्यवस्थित और सुसंस्कृत और परिष्कृत। यह कहना न भूलें कि इस शब्द का उपयोग करने वाले कोने में उस आदमी का अधिकार है, जो तुरंत आपकी शब्दावली का उपयोग करेगा। बहुत suave इसलिए स्मार्ट शब्द संख्या चार पर अत्याचार अत्याचारी शब्द है, अत्याचारी शब्द का अर्थ है, वास्तव में बुरा भयानक भयानक क्रूर, जो आक्रामक अत्याचार को भड़काने वाला लैटिन शब्द है। जिसका अर्थ है कि क्रूर या भयानक शब्द का कुछ उदाहरण है कि अत्याचारी शब्द डेल्ही में हाल ही में हुई बलात्कार की घटनाएं हैं। या कैदियों का इलाज किया जाता है। जेल में कभी-कभी अत्याचारपूर्ण तरीके से कुछ सामान्य गलत कामों के बारे में बात करने के लिए दिन-प्रतिदिन अत्याचार का भी उपयोग किया जाता है और आप इसे अतिरंजित करना चाहते हैं। उदाहरण के लिए उनके टेबल मैनर्स अत्याचारी थे या उनकी पोशाक भावना इतनी अत्याचारी है या उनका व्याकरण अत्याचारी है। तो अगली बार जब आप समाचार पर एक भयावह कार्य के बारे में याद करते हैं। टिप्पणी और कहना है कि यह एक अत्याचारी कृत्य है स्मार्ट शब्द संख्या 5 मूर्ख, मूर्ख, मूर्ख, अद्भुत आश्चर्यजनक है। अब हम अक्सर यहाँ भयानक शब्द का उपयोग करते हैं ' एक और शब्द जो आप उदाहरण के लिए भयानक बेवकूफ़ के स्थान पर उपयोग कर सकते हैं आज मुझे मेरे परीक्षण पर एक शानदार स्कोर मिला जिसका मतलब है कि मुझे एक बहुत ही उच्च स्कोर मिला या। मुझे एक सही-सही अंक मिला है कि शब्द के शब्द का अर्थ है कि शब्द का शास्त्रीय लैटिन मूल जड़ है। स्तब्ध रह जाना इतना मूर्खतापूर्ण है कि किसी चीज का वर्णन करने के लिए प्रयोग किया जाता है जो आश्चर्यजनक रूप से अच्छा होता है उदाहरण के लिए वह उस पोशाक में शानदार दिखती है या इस बालकनी से क्या शानदार दृश्य है या मैं इस मूर्खतापूर्ण पुस्तक को पढ़ रहा हूं कि मैं नीचे नहीं जा सकता कि कैसे जाना है और कहना। आपके मित्र जो छात्रों के लिए यह बेवकूफी भरा चैनल है और कुछ अन्य शब्द जो आप बेवकूफ़ के बजाय इस्तेमाल कर सकते हैं वे अविश्वसनीय शानदार या असाधारण रूप से अच्छे हैं इसलिए इससे पहले कि हम इस वीडियो पर एक टिप्पणी डालने के लिए याद रखें इस वीडियो पर संतुलित पाँच शब्द जारी रखें। मुझे यह बताने के लिए कि इन दस शब्दों में से आपका पसंदीदा स्मार्ट शब्द नंबर छह कौन सा है, एक फ़िक्स में ठीक होने का मतलब है उदाहरण के लिए एक परेशानी की स्थिति में होना, मैं एक तय समय में हूँ क्योंकि मैंने इसके लिए दो अलग-अलग दोस्तों के साथ योजना बनाई है संध्या। मैंने अपना फोन खो दिया है और मैं ठीक कर रहा हूं या हमारी बस आज सुबह टूट गई है और मैं ठीक कर रहा हूं मेरे दोस्त हमेशा मदद के लिए मेरे पास जाते हैं जब वह ठीक होता है और जब वह अच्छा होता है तो वह भूल जाता है। अगली बार जब आप उदाहरण के लिए स्कूल से गणित का होमवर्क प्राप्त करते हैं और यदि आपने अपनी गणित की किताब स्कूल में छोड़ दी है, त",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"[151] अन्य विकिपीडिया के बारे में कहते हैं कि कोई भी संपादन कर सकता है जैसे द ऑफिस के एक प्रकरण ""द नेगोशिएशन"", जिसमें पात्र माइकल स्कॉट ने कहा, ""विकिपीडिया एक सबसे अच्छी चीज है"".",Hindi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"इस दुनिया में कोई भी किसी भी विषय के बारे में कुछ भी लिख सकता है, इसलिए आप जानते हैं कि आपको सर्वोत्तम संभव जानकारी मिल रही है।"" कुछ चयनित विकिपीडिया की नीतियों जैसे xkcd स्ट्रिप को ""विकिपिडियन प्रोटेस्टर"" नाम दिया गया है। अप्रैल 2008 में डच फिल्म निर्माता एईजेसब्रांड वॉन वीलेन ने अपने 45 मिनट के टेलीविजन वृत्तचित्र ""द ट्रुथ अकार्डिंग टु विकिपीडिया"" का प्रसारण किया।[152] विकिपीडिया के बारे में एक और वृत्तचित्र शीर्षक "" ट्रुथ इन नंबर्स: द विकिपीडिया स्टोरी"" 2009 प्रदर्शन के लिए निर्धारित है। कई महाद्वीपों पर शूट की गयी, यह फिल्म विकिपीडिया के इतिहास और दुनिया भर में विकिपीडिया के संपादकों के साथ किये गए साक्षात्कारों को कवर करेगी। [153][154] 28 सितंबर 2007 को, इतालवी राजनीतिज्ञ फ्रेंको ग्रिल्लिनी ने चित्रमाला की स्वतंत्रता की आवश्यकता के बारे में सांस्कृतिक संसाधन और गतिविधियों के मंत्री के सम्नाक्ष संसदीय प्रश्न उठाया। उन्होंने कहा कि ऐसी आजादी की कमी विकिपीडिया पर दबाव बनाती है,"" जो सातवीं ऐसी वेबसाईट है जिस पर लोग विजित करते हैं"" यह आधुनिक इतालवी इमारतों और कला की सभी छवियों पर रोक लगाती है और दावा किया कि इसने पर्यटन राजस्व को बेहद क्षति पहुँचायी है। 
[155] 16 सितंबर 2007 को द वाशिंगटन पोस्ट ने सूचना दी कि विकिपीडिया 2008 अमेरिकी चुनाव अभियान में एक केंद्र बिन्दु बन गया, इसके अनुसार ""जब आप गूगल में उम्मीदवार का नाम टाइप करते हैं, एक विकिपीडिया पृष्ठ ही पहला परिणाम होता है, यह इन प्रविष्टियों को उतना ही महत्वपूर्ण बनता है जितना कि एक उम्मीदवार को परिभाषित करना.",Hindi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"पहले से ही, राष्ट्रपति प्रविष्टियों को प्रतिदिन अनगिनत बार संपादित, अवलोकित किया जा रहा है और इस पर विचार-विमर्श किया जा रहा है।"" [156] अक्टूबर 2007 के रायटर्स लेख शीर्षक ""विकिपीडिया पेज द लेटेस्ट स्टेटस सिम्बल"" में इस घटना पर रिपोर्ट दी गयी कि कैसे एक विकिपीडिया लेख किसी की विख्याति को साबित करता है।[157] विकिपीडिया ने मई 2004 में दो प्रमुख पुरस्कार जीते। [158] पहला था, वार्षिक प्रिक्स अर्स इलेक्ट्रोनिका प्रतियोगिता में गोल्डन निका फॉर डिजीटल कमयूनिटीस; यह पुरस्कार € 10000 (£ 6588; $ 12,700) अनुदान के साथ आया था और इसके साथ ऑस्ट्रिया में पी ए ई सइबरआर्ट्स समारोह में उस वर्ष दस्तावेज़ करने के लिए एक निमंत्रण भी प्राप्त किया गया था। 
दूसरा, ""समुदाय"" श्रेणी के लिए में न्यायाधीशों का वेब्बी अवार्ड था।[159] विकिपीडिया को ""बेस्ट प्रक्टिसस"" वेब्बी के लिए मनोनीत किया गया। 26 जनवरी 2007 को, विकिपीडिया को ब्रांडचैनल.कॉम के पाठकों द्वारा सर्वोत्तम चौथी ब्रांड श्रेणी से सम्मानित किया गया था; ""किस ब्रांड ने 2006 में हमारे जीवन पर सर्वाधिक प्रभाव डाला"" सवाल के जवाब में 15% मतदान प्राप्त किया गया।[160] सितम्बर 2008 में, विकिपीडिया ने बोरिस टाडिक, एकार्ट होफ्लिंग और पीटर गेब्रियल के साथ वेर्कस्टाट डॉइशलैंड का क्वाडि्ृगा अ मिशन ऑफ़ एनलाइटएनमेंट पुरस्कार प्राप्त किया। यह पुरस्कार जिमी वेल्स को डेविड वेंबेर्गेर द्वारा पेश किया गया।[161] जनता द्वारा लिखित इंटरैक्टिव मल्टीमीडिया विश्वकोश की असंख्य प्रविष्टियाॅं, विकिपीडिया की स्थापना से भी लंबे (लम्बे) समय पहले मौजूद थीं। इनमें से पहला था 1986 BBC डोमस्डे प्रोजेक्ट, जिसमें ब्रिटेन के 1 मिलियन से अधिक योगदानकर्ताओं के पाठ्य (BBC माइक्रो कंप्यूटर पर प्रविष्ट) और तस्वीरें शामिल थीं और यह ब्रिटेन के भूगोल, कला और संस्कृति को कवर करता था। यह पहला इंटरैक्टिव मल्टीमीडिया विश्वकोश था (और साथ ही आंतरिक लिंक्स के माध्यम से जुड़ा पहला मुख्य मल्टीमीडिया दस्तावेज़ भी था), इसमें अधिकांश लेख ब्रिटेन के एक इंटरेक्टिव मानचित्र के माध्यम से उपलब्ध थे। उपयोगकर्ता इंटरफ़ेस और डोमस्डे प्रोजेक्ट के अवयवों के एक हिस्से को अब एक वेबसाईट पर डाल दिया गया है। [162] सबसे सफल प्रारंभिक ऑनलाइन विश्वकोशों में से एक था h2g2 जिस पर जनता के द्वारा प्रविष्टियाँ की जाती थीं, जिसे डगलस एडम्स के द्वारा निर्मित किया गया और इसे BBC के द्वारा चलाया जाता है। h2g2 विश्वकोश तुलनात्मक रूप से हल्का फुल्का था, यह उन लेखों पर ध्यान केन्द्रित करता था जो हास्यपूर्ण भी हों और जानकारीपूर्ण भी हों।
इन दोनों परियोजनाओं में विकिपीडिया के साथ समानता थी, लेकिन दोंनों में से किसी ने भी सार्वजनिक उपयोगकर्ताओं को पूर्ण संपादकीय स्वतंत्रता नहीं दी। ऐसी ही एक गैर-विकी परियोजना GNU पीडिया परियोजना, अपने इतिहास के आरम्भ में न्यूपीडिया के साथ उपस्थित थी; हालाँकि इसे सेवानिवृत्त कर दिया गया है और इसके निर्माता मुफ्त सॉफ्टवेयर व्यक्ति रिचर्ड स्टालमेन ने विकिपीडिया को समर्थन दिया है। 
[21] विकिपीडिया ने कई सम्बन्धी परियोजनाओं का सूत्रपात भी किया है, इन्हें भी विकिमीडिया फाउंडेशन द्वारा संचालित किया जाता है। पहला, ""इन मेमोरियम: सितंबर 11 विकी"",[163] अक्टूबर 2002 में निर्मित,[164] जो 11 सितंबर के हमलों को विस्तृत किया; इस परियोजना को अक्टूबर 2006 में बंद कर दिया गया था। विकटियोनरी, एक शब्दकोश परियोजना, दिसंबर 2002 में शुरू की गई थी;[165] विकिकोट कोटेशन्स का एक संग्रह, जो विकिमीडिया के उदघाटन के एक सप्ताह बाद शुरू हुआ और विकिबुक्स सहयोग से लिखी गयी मुफ्त पुस्तकों का एक संग्रह.",Hindi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"तब से विकिमीडिया ने कई अन्य परियोजनाएं शुरू की हैं, इसमें विकीवर्सिटी भी शामिल है, यह मुफ्त अध्ययन सामग्री के निर्माण के लिए और ऑनलाइन शिक्षण गतिविधियों का प्रावधान करने की परियोजना है। 
[166] हालाँकि, इन में से कोई भी सम्बंधित परियोजना, विकिपीडिया की सफलता प्राप्ति में सहायक नहीं रही है। विकिपीडिया की जानकारी के कुछ उपसमुच्चय अक्सर विशिष्ट उद्देश्य के लिए अतिरिक्त समीक्षा के साथ विकसित किये गए हैं। उदाहरण के लिए, विकिपीडीयन्स और SOS बच्चों के द्वारा निर्मित CD /DVD की विकिपीडिया श्रृंखला (उर्फ ""विकिपीडिया फॉर स्कूल्स""), एक मुफ्त, हाथ से जांच की गयी, विकिपीडिया से गैर वाणिज्यिक चुनाव है, जो ब्रिटेन के राष्ट्रीय पाठ्यक्रम में लक्षित है और अधिकांश अंग्रेजी भाषी दुनिया के लिए उपयोगी है। 
विकिपीडिया फॉर स्कूल्स ऑनलाइन उपलब्ध है: एक समकक्ष प्रिंट विश्वकोश के लिए लगभग बीस संस्करणों की आवश्यकता होगी।
ये विकिपीडिया के लेख के एक सलेक्ट सबसेट को एक मुद्रित पुस्तक रूप देने का प्रयास भी किया गया है।
[167] सहयोगी ज्ञान आधार विकास पर केन्द्रित अन्य वेबसाईटों ने या तो विकिपीडिया से प्रेरणा प्राप्त की है या उसे प्रेरित किया है।
कुछ, जैसे सुस्निंग.नु (Susning.nu), एनसिक्लोपेडिया लीब्रे (Enciclopedia Libre) और विकिज़नानी (WikiZnanie) किसी औपचारिक समीक्षा प्रक्रिया का इस्तेमाल नहीं करते है, जबकि अन्य जैसे एनसाइक्लोपीडिया ऑफ़ लाइफ (Encyclopedia of Life), स्टैनफोर्ड एनसाइक्लोपीडिया ऑफ़ फिलोसोफी (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy), स्कोलरपीडिया (Scholarpedia), h2g2, एव्रीथिंग2 (Everything2), अधिक पारंपरिक सहकर्मी समीक्षा का उपयोग करते है। एक ऑनलाइन विश्वकोश, सिटिज़नडियम को विकिपीडिया के सह-संस्थापक लैरी सेंगर के द्वारा विकिपीडिया के ""विशेषज्ञ अनुकूल"" का निर्माण करने के प्रयास में शुरू किया गया था।[168][169][170] निर्देशांक: 37°47′13″N 122°23′59″W﻿ / ﻿37.78697°N 122.399677°W﻿ / 37.78697; -122.399677 विकिमीडिया संस्थान एक अमेरिकी गैर-लाभकारी संस्थान है, जिसका मुख्यालय सैन फ्रांसिस्को, कैलिफोर्निया में स्थित है। इसकी स्थापना जिमी वेल्स ने 20 जून 2003 को की थी। यह दान में प्राप्त पैसों से संचालित होता है। इस संस्थान की सबसे अधिक प्रसिद्ध परियोजना विकिपीडिया है। इसके अलावा भी कई अन्य परियोजनाओं को शुरू किया गया था। जिसमें विक्षनरी (शब्दकोश), विकिस्रोत, विकिसमाचार, विकिसूक्ति, विकिपुस्तक, विकियात्रा आदि हैं। इसके अलावा कई ऐसे प्रकल्प भी है, जिसमें सभी भाषाओं के सदस्य योगदान देते हैं। इसमें मेटा विकि, इनक्यूबेटर, कॉमन्स आदि हैं। विकिमीडिया संस्थान का उद्देश्य मुफ्त लाइसेंस या सार्वजनिक कार्यक्रम (public domain) के अन्तर्गत, शैक्षणिक सामग्री एकत्रित करके विश्व के लोगों को सशक्त एवं व्यस्त बनाना, एवं इसे भूमण्डल में प्रभाविकता से प्रसारित करना है। अध्यायों के अन्तरजाल की सहायता से, संस्थान एक से अधिक भाषा के लिये विकि प्रोजेक्ट एवं अन्य प्रयत्न, जो कि उद्देश्य की और अग्रसर है, की सहायता एवं विकास के लिये मूलभूत और संगठित ढांचा प्रदान करता है। संस्थान इन प्रॉजेक्ट्स की मदद से निरन्तर इंटरनेट पर मुफ्त उपयोगी सूचना उपलब्ध करायेगा। विकिमीडिया फ्लोरिडा, अमेरिका के कानून के अंतर्गत एक बिना-लाभार्जन की दानपुण्य संस्था है। पूरी तरह से हिसाब रखने वाला विकिमीडिया संस्थान गाइडस्टार एवं इसकी भागीदार साइटों पर एक दानपुण्य संस्था के रूप में सूचित है। विकिमिडिया संस्थान अमेरिका में ५०१(सी)(३) कर-मुक्त स्थिति में है। विकिमीडिया संस्थान प्रसिद्ध कार्यकारी एनसायक्लोपीडिया, विकिपीडिया, २००६ के अंत तक विश्व में सबसे ज्यादा देखी जाने वाली १५ वेबसाइटों में से एक, को सहयोग देता है। जनवरी, २००१ में विकिपीडिया की स्थापना, एवं जून, २००३ में विकिमीडिया संस्थान की समविष्टि से इसकी प्रगति विस्मयित रही है। अंग्रेजी-भाषा विकिपीडिया, इसका प्रथम कार्यक्रम, समाविष्टि के बाद से १.३५ लाख लेखों से आज १५० लाख लेख तक पहुँच गया है। ३९ अन्य-भाषाओं की विकिपीडिया पर अपनी भाषा में १००,००० से ज्यादा लेख लिखे जा चुके हैं। साथ ही साथ, संस्थान विकिपीडिया के अतिरिक्त, अन्य कई प्रोजेक्टों को संचालित करता है, जैसे कि विकिमीडिया कोमन्स, मुफ्त चित्रों एवं मीडिया का संग्रहण, जिसने नवंबर २००६ में दस लाख चित्रों का आंकडा पार किया है। विक्शनरी, मुफ्त शब्दकोष, ८ अलग-अलग भाषाओं में ५०,००० शब्दों से ज्यादा प्रविष्टियां रखता है, जिनमें से तीन २००,००० से ज्यादा परिभाषायें रखते हैं। विकिसोर्स, एक भौतिक स्रोत संग्रहण, लगभग १५०,००० पृष्टों का संग्रहण है। विकिकोटे (उद्धरण), विकिबुक्स (आपसी सहयोग से लिखी पुस्तकें), विकिन्यूज (नगरीय समाचार पत्र), विकिवर्सिटी (पाठ्यक्रम विकास), ये सब उसी रफ्तार से अग्रसर है। कुल मिलाकर, इन कार्यक्रम में ७८ लाख से अधिक पृष्ट, २२ लाख से अधिक चित्र, एवं ५० लाख से अधिक पंजीकृत खाते हैं। विकिट्रेवल, ओमेगाविकि, एवं विकिआ, संस्थान के द्वारा संचालित कार्यक्रम नहीं है। अंग्रेज़ी (w)  · सेबुआनो (w)  ·

.हम सभी अंग्रेजी में और अधिक धाराप्रवाह बनने के त्वरित तरीकों की तलाश कर रहे हैं, मुझे पता है कि मुझे पता है कि क्या होता है कि हमारे मस्तिष्क को चक्कर लगाने वाले कुछ शब्द हैं और हमें इस पूरी बातचीत को केवल अद्भुत अद्भुत शांत या महाकाव्य का उपयोग करने की आवश्यकता है ताकि हम कैसे हो कुछ नए नए अंग्रेजी शब्द सीखें जिन्हें आप अपने दैनिक जीवन में उपयोग कर सकते हैं और अपनी शब्दावली मिनटों में बढ़ा सकते हैं। तो आज हम 10 नए स्मार्ट शब्दों को सीखने के लिए जा रहे हैं उनके अर्थ मूल शब्द और उदाहरण वाक्य ताकि हम जा रहे हैं अरे यह सब हो रहा है और आप देख रहे हैं। और इस वीडियो में मैं आपको दैनिक उपयोग के लिए और इस वीडियो के अंत में 10 स्मार्ट शब्द देने जा रहा हूं। मैं भी आपको वास्तव में धाराप्रवाह स्मार्ट शब्द संख्या ध्वनि करने के लिए एक स्मार्ट टिप देने जा रहा हूं। एक दलित दलदल में बह जाने का मतलब है डूबना या बाढ़ आना लेकिन दलदल का इस्तेमाल अक्सर काम के संदर्भ में किया जाता है जैसे कि ' काम के साथ मैं बहुत ज्यादा काम करने के लिए तैयार हूँ, मुझे इस पूरे हफ्ते काम के साथ दलदली होना पड़ा है और मुश्किल से सांस लेने का समय मिला है अब इस शब्द की जड़ को देखते हैं। दलदल आर्द्रभूमि का एक टुकड़ा है और अगर कोई दलदल में गलत जगह पर कदम रखता है तो वे आसानी से डूब सकते हैं और दलदल का क्रिया रूप डूबने का मतलब है कि यहां आप इस शब्द का उपयोग कैसे कर सकते हैं। मान लीजिए कि आपके पास बहुत सारे असाइनमेंट हैं और आपके पास एक परीक्षा आ रही है और आपके मित्र आपके पास आते हैं और वे कहते हैं। अरे, आप हमारे साथ क्यों नहीं घूमते हैं, आप उनसे कह सकते हैं कि मुझे बहुत खेद है, लेकिन मैं काम से बह गया हूं या मैंने कुछ अन्य शब्दों को स्वाहा कर दिया है, जिनका उपयोग आप दलदली के स्थान पर कर सकते हैं, मुझे बहुत अधिक मिला है ऐसा करने के लिए। मेरी प्लेट पर बहुत अधिक है मैं काम में डूब रहा हूं। मैं असाइनमेंट के साथ बहक गया हूँ स्मार्ट शब्द नंबर दो को पकड़ना है -22 अब मुझे यकीन है ' इस शब्द को कैच -22 से पहले सुना है, इसका मतलब एक असंभव स्थिति है जिसमें आप एक काम नहीं कर सकते हैं जब तक कि आपने दूसरे को नहीं किया है और आप दूसरे को नहीं कर सकते क्योंकि आपने पहले नहीं किया है। मैंने आपको भ्रमित किया है ताकि मैं आपको कुछ उदाहरण दे सकूं, जब आपको कार्य अनुभव के बिना नौकरी नहीं मिलती है, तो यह एक स्थिति है। लेकिन आप अनुभव प्राप्त नहीं कर सकते हैं जब तक कि आप एक नौकरी पकड़ने -22 प्राप्त नहीं करते हैं, जोसेफ हेलर द्वारा उसी नाम कैच -22 की अपनी प्रसिद्ध पुस्तक में गढ़ा गया था जब वह कुछ विरोधाभासी नियमों का वर्णन कर रहे थे जो विश्व युद्ध दो के दौरान सैनिकों पर लागू थे। कैच -22 का एक और उदाहरण आपको बैंक ऋण की आवश्यकता है क्योंकि आपके पास पर्याप्त नहीं है। जब तक आप बैंक को यह साबित नहीं कर देते कि आपके पास पर्याप्त पैसा है, तब तक आपको वह बैंक ऋण नहीं मिलेगा, अगली बार जब आप मुश्किल स्थिति में फंसेंगे तो याद रखें। शब्द -22 का उपयोग करने के लिए। और इन प्रशंसात्मक शब्दों को अपने दोस्तों के दूसरे शब्दों से प्राप्त करें जिन्हें आप कैच -22 के स्थान पर उपयोग कर सकते हैं वे विरोधाभास या दुविधा वाले स्मार्ट शब्द हैं। नंबर तीन है सवेव सवेव का अर्थ है विनम्र शांत और परिष्कृत होने के लिए परिष्कृत होना। सुविचारित शब्द सुवे के कई अलग-अलग मूल हैं लेकिन शब्द का एक बहुत ही रोचक मूल है जिसका अर्थ है सुखद या मीठा स्वाद। वह विशेष रूप से महिलाओं या बराक ओबामा के सामने इतनी मार्मिक और सुसाइड करने वाली है कि अब अगली बार किसी पार्टी में जाने पर उसे याद रखना बहुत आसान और पॉलिश है और आप इस व्यक्ति को देखते हैं। सुव्यवस्थित और सुसंस्कृत और परिष्कृत। यह कहना न भूलें कि इस शब्द का उपयोग करने वाले कोने में उस आदमी का अधिकार है, जो तुरंत आपकी शब्दावली का उपयोग करेगा। बहुत suave इसलिए स्मार्ट शब्द संख्या चार पर अत्याचार अत्याचारी शब्द है, अत्याचारी शब्द का अर्थ है, वास्तव में बुरा भयानक भयानक क्रूर, जो आक्रामक अत्याचार को भड़काने वाला लैटिन शब्द है। जिसका अर्थ है कि क्रूर या भयानक शब्द का कुछ उदाहरण है कि अत्याचारी शब्द डेल्ही में हाल ही में हुई बलात्कार की घटनाएं हैं। या कैदियों का इलाज किया जाता है। जेल में कभी-कभी अत्याचारपूर्ण तरीके से कुछ सामान्य गलत कामों के बारे में बात करने के लिए दिन-प्रतिदिन अत्याचार का भी उपयोग किया जाता है और आप इसे अतिरंजित करना चाहते हैं। उदाहरण के लिए उनके टेबल मैनर्स अत्याचारी थे या उनकी पोशाक भावना इतनी अत्याचारी है या उनका व्याकरण अत्याचारी है। तो अगली बार जब आप समाचार पर एक भयावह कार्य के बारे में याद करते हैं। टिप्पणी और कहना है कि यह एक अत्याचारी कृत्य है स्मार्ट शब्द संख्या 5 मूर्ख, मूर्ख, मूर्ख, अद्भुत आश्चर्यजनक है। अब हम अक्सर यहाँ भयानक शब्द का उपयोग करते हैं ' एक और शब्द जो आप उदाहरण के लिए भयानक बेवकूफ़ के स्थान पर उपयोग कर सकते हैं आज मुझे मेरे परीक्षण पर एक शानदार स्कोर मिला जिसका मतलब है कि मुझे एक बहुत ही उच्च स्कोर मिला या। मुझे एक सही-सही अंक मिला है कि शब्द के शब्द का अर्थ है कि शब्द का शास्त्रीय लैटिन मूल जड़ है। स्तब्ध रह जाना इतना मूर्खतापूर्ण है कि किसी चीज का वर्णन करने के लिए प्रयोग किया जाता है जो आश्चर्यजनक रूप से अच्छा होता है उदाहरण के लिए वह उस पोशाक में शानदार दिखती है या इस बालकनी से क्या शानदार दृश्य है या मैं इस मूर्खतापूर्ण पुस्तक को पढ़ रहा हूं कि मैं नीचे नहीं जा सकता कि कैसे जाना है और कहना। आपके मित्र जो छात्रों के लिए यह बेवकूफी भरा चैनल है और कुछ अन्य शब्द जो आप बेवकूफ़ के बजाय इस्तेमाल कर सकते हैं वे अविश्वसनीय शानदार या असाधारण रूप से अच्छे हैं इसलिए इससे पहले कि हम इस वीडियो पर एक टिप्पणी डालने के लिए याद रखें इस वीडियो पर संतुलित पाँच शब्द जारी रखें। मुझे यह बताने के लिए कि इन दस शब्दों में से आपका पसंदीदा स्मार्ट शब्द नंबर छह कौन सा है, एक फ़िक्स में ठीक होने का मतलब है उदाहरण के लिए एक परेशानी की स्थिति में होना, मैं एक तय समय में हूँ क्योंकि मैंने इसके लिए दो अलग-अलग दोस्तों के साथ योजना बनाई है संध्या। मैंने अपना फोन खो दिया है और मैं ठीक कर रहा हूं या हमारी बस आज सुबह टूट गई है और मैं ठीक कर रहा हूं मेरे दोस्त हमेशा मदद के लिए मेरे पास जाते हैं जब वह ठीक होता है और जब वह अच्छा होता है तो वह भूल जाता है। अगली बार जब आप उदाहरण के लिए स्कूल से गणित का होमवर्क प्राप्त करते हैं और यदि आपने अपनी गणित की किताब स्कूल में छोड़ दी है, त",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 आप अपने दोस्तों को बता सकते हैं कि आप एक वास्तविक फिक्स में हैं, अब आप सोच सकते हैं कि शब्द फिक्स का कुछ करना है कुछ मरम्मत के साथ। लेकिन एक फिक्स में कोई भी परेशानी का मतलब नहीं है एक परेशानी की स्थिति में दूसरे शब्दों का उपयोग करें जिन्हें आप एक फिक्स में उपयोग कर सकते हैं मैं एक सूप में हूं या मैं ' एक गड़बड़ में हूँ या मैं परेशान के एक स्थान पर हूँ या बस मैं एक स्पॉट में हूँ स्मार्ट शब्द संख्या 7 है फ्लुमॉक्स फ्लुमोक्स का मतलब किसी को भ्रमित करना है। इतना है कि वे भूल जाते हैं कि अब क्या करना है उलझन में एक अति प्रयोग शब्द हो जाता है तो इसके बजाय आप उदाहरण के लिए flummox का उपयोग क्यों नहीं करते हैं। लड़का पूरी तरह से दिखता है ।flummoxed जब शिक्षक ने उसे कक्षा में एक सवाल पूछा या कुत्ते को देख शराबी हो गया। दर्पण में अपने स्वयं के प्रतिबिंब या पर्यटक को अलग-अलग रीति-रिवाजों से लाद दिया गया था। अपनी यात्रा के दौरान या एक साक्षात्कार के दौरान उनका सामना हुआ, जब उनसे पूछा गया कि हम आपको क्यों काम पर रखें तो अगली बार जब आप किसी परीक्षा में उदाहरण के लिए किसी भी प्रश्न पर भ्रमित हो जाते हैं, तो वह अगली बार पूरी तरह से झुलस गए। हमेशा कह सकते हैं कि क्योंकि मैं था ' परीक्षा के लिए बहुत अच्छी तरह से तैयार किया गया था I कुछ सवालों के झटके से घिरे हुए थे जिन्हें आप flummoxed के बजाय उपयोग कर सकते हैं वे घबराए हुए हैं या हैरान हो गए हैं स्मार्ट शब्द संख्या आठ का एक प्रकार का संगीत दिया गया है। उदाहरण के लिए बैठक या तारीख कहने का एक बहुत ही फ्रेंच तरीका है, मेरे पास शनिवार को दोपहर के भोजन पर अपने दोस्तों के साथ एक मिलन स्थल है या मैं फिल्मों के लिए मॉल में अपने दोस्तों के साथ मुलाकात करने की योजना बना रहा हूं, फिल्मों के लिए एक संज्ञा या एक क्रिया के रूप में इस्तेमाल किया जा सकता है उदाहरण के लिए। आज शाम को मैं अपने दोस्तों के साथ एक मुलाकात कर रहा हूँ या मैं कल अपने दोस्तों के साथ मिलने जा रहा हूँ। सेना द्वारा सैनिकों के लिए एक बैठक की जगह को इंगित करने के लिए सेना द्वारा एक बैठक स्थान का संकेत देने के लिए इस्तेमाल किया गया था, अब कुछ संक्षिप्त और गुप्त शब्द है, भले ही अब आप किसी भी बैठक के लिए मुलाकात का उपयोग कर सकते हैं। सामान्य तौर पर लेकिन यह जीता ' आधिकारिक मीटिंग के लिए टी बहुत उपयुक्त है, इसलिए यदि आपके पास एक तारीख है, तो आप निश्चित रूप से कह सकते हैं कि एक गूढ़ स्मार्ट शब्द संख्या 9 है, जो कि आपत्तिजनक है, यह एक अपमान है जिसे आप इसका उपयोग तब करेंगे जब आप किसी को गूंगा या अनजाने में कॉल करने का प्रयास कर रहे हों। या मंद-व्यंजित अब आपने सुना है शब्द ज्यामिति obtuse कोण और तीव्र कोण में इसलिए एक obtuse कोण 90 डिग्री से अधिक कोण है, लेकिन 180 डिग्री से कम है। और एक तीव्र कोण यह तीक्ष्ण कोण है जो 90 डिग्री से कम इतना तीव्र है क्योंकि एक शब्द का उपयोग तीखे को व्यक्त करने के लिए किया जाता है और इसलिए मानसिक रूप से भी तेज है और इसलिए कि यह कुंद कुंद करने से इनकार कर रहा है। तो यह भी मन में थोड़ा धीमा होता है इसलिए उदाहरण के साथ अपशब्द भी आदमी होते हैं। ऐसा करने के लिए वह एक फर्जी कॉल करने वाला बच्चा या मोटापे से ग्रस्त बच्चे को अपना पासवर्ड दे देता था। सक्षम नहीं था। परीक्षण पर एक ही सवाल का जवाब देने के लिए या मोटापे से ग्रस्त व्यक्ति को एक कठिन समय था यहां तक ​​कि बुनियादी निर्देशों को समझना अब दैनिक जीवन में आपकी स्थिति में है कि आपका प्रेमी या आपकी प्रेमिका आपसे नाराज है और आपको नहीं पता कि आप ऐसा क्यों कर सकते हैं। उनसे कहें कि शायद मैं अडिग हूं, लेकिन मुझे नहीं पता कि आप इतने परेशान क्यों हैं कि स्मार्ट शब्द संख्या 10 सुस्त सुस्त सुस्त है, धीमे धीमे चलने के लिए धीमी गति से चलने का मतलब है। सामान्य से थोड़ा थका हुआ और कमी महसूस करने के लिए। ऊर्जा उदाहरण में एक भारी दोपहर का भोजन मुझे दोपहर में बहुत सुस्त बना देता है शब्द से जड़ें होती हैं जिसका अर्थ है कि एक धीमा व्यक्ति और एक सुस्त एक जानवर है जो घोंघे के उदाहरणों की तरह वास्तव में बहुत धीरे-धीरे चलता है। इस साल अर्थव्यवस्था बहुत सुस्त रही है या मैच की शुरुआत सुस्त रही। या व्यवसाय इस तिमाही में सुस्त रहा है आप इसे अपने दैनिक जीवन में उपयोग कर सकते हैं यदि आप एक दिन बहुत थक गए हैं तो आप अपनी माँ को बता सकते हैं या आप बता सकते हैं। आपके दोस्त मुझे बहुत सुस्त लग रहे हैं। आज मैं एनर्जी ड्रिंक के साथ दूसरे शब्दों का उपयोग कर सकता हूं जिन्हें आप सुस्त के स्थान पर उपयोग कर सकते हैं, सुस्त हो सकते हैं या मेरे पैरों को खींच सकते हैं, इसलिए वे 10 स्मार्ट शब्द और पहले थे। मैं आपको उस गुप्त टिप को बहुत धाराप्रवाह ध्वनि देने के लिए देता हूं जिसे मैं आपको याद दिलाना चाहता हूं। यदि आप स्मार्ट शब्दों को टेलीफोन कॉल पर उपयोग करने के लिए देख रहे हैं तो मैं एक वीडियो का लिंक डाल रहा हूं। उस के लिए विवरण बॉक्स में नीचे और अब ध्वनि धाराप्रवाह के लिए गुप्त टिप को एक से अधिक स्मार्ट शब्द या वाक्य का उपयोग नहीं करना है जो वे कभी-कभी जानते हैं। हम बहुत उत्साहित हैं क्योंकि हम ' इन स्मार्ट शब्दों की एक पूरी बहुत कुछ सीखा है और हम उनमें से दो तीन चार को एक वाक्य में लिख देते हैं जो स्वाभाविक नहीं लगता है। इसलिए एक समय में सुनिश्चित करें कि आप उच्चारण कर रहे हैं। सही तरीके से शब्द Google पर जाएं और शब्द लिखें और शीर्ष पर दाईं ओर खोज में आपको एक छोटा स्पीकर आइकन दिखाई देगा, उस स्पीकर पर क्लिक करें। और एक या दो बार उच्चारण सुनें। और आप जाने के लिए तैयार हैं और अगर आपको यह वीडियो पसंद आया है तो हमें टिप्पणी के साथ अंगूठा देना न भूलें। मेरे लिए इसके तहत मुझे बता रहा हूँ कि इन 10 शब्दों में से आपका पसंदीदा और क्या है। यदि आपने सदस्यता बटन और घंटी आइकन को पहले से ही दबाया नहीं है और इसे देखना सुखद है। हे दोस्तों इस वीडियो में मेरे चैनल में आपका स्वागत है। मैं आपको शीर्ष 50 अंग्रेजी वाक्यांश देने जा रहा हूं जिन्हें आप अपने रोजमर्रा के जीवन में उपयोग कर सकते

महिला रहती थी जिसका नाम मैरियन था। अपनी इकलौती बेटी के साथ नरसिंह की शादी बेहद विनम्र और मीठी नशीली थी लेकिन पूरी तरह से इसके विपरीत आप देख सकते हैं कि वह उन शब्दों से परे सुंदर थी जो वह एक जीने की तरह थी। गुड़िया और सबसे मनोरंजक हिस्सा वह खुद को प्यार करता है कोई अंत नहीं होगा narcisa तुम। मुझे रोटी बनाने में मदद करें हुह कोई रास्ता नहीं माँ आटा मेरे सभी उज्ज्वल और स्पार्कली आँखें नौकरानियों। narcisa क्या आप मुझे इन बीजों को लगाने में मदद करेंगी कि मैं ऐसा क्यों करूँगी कि मुझे क्या मिला है जो मेरी प्यारी उँगलियों पर यह सब खराब हो गया है, अगर यह मेरे चेहरे पर अच्छी तरह से चला गया तो यह नरसीसा की समस्या थी। उसने खुद को किसी भी काम को करने के लिए बहुत सोचा था कि कई आत्महत्या करने वाले लोग शादी में नशीली वस्तुओं का हाथ मांगने आए थे। चूँकि उसकी सुंदरता दूर-दूर तक जानी जाती थी, लेकिन उसने उन सभी को बहुत ही अशिष्टता से अस्वीकार कर दिया, तो आपने उन पुरुषों को कल क्यों भेज दिया, उन्हें अच्छा लग रहा था कि आप उनमें से एक गंभीर माँ नहीं हो सकती हैं। ऐसी छोटी आँखें लगभग एक चिड़िया की तरह थीं और दूसरी के पास एक बड़ी नाक थी जो मैं उसके पास नहीं होना चाहता था। जब उन्होंने ओह ओह और आखिरी पड़ाव छींक दिया, तो मैं किसी भी अधिक सुनना नहीं चाहता, मैं यह देख सकता था कि वे लोग वास्तव में बहुत अच्छे थे मेरे प्रिय आपको उस सुंदरता को जानना चाहिए। वह सब कुछ नहीं है, जिसे आपको महसूस करना है कि मैं किसी राजकुमार या शूरवीर की तरह हूं। ओह प्रिय एक रात जब वह सो रही थी उसकी माँ उसे देख रही थी। मेरे प्यारे बच्चे तुम बहुत सुंदर और प्यारे हो लेकिन तुम्हें अपनी खूबसूरती के अलावा किसी और चीज की परवाह नहीं है। उस पल में नार्सीसस को नींद में हंसना शुरू कर दिया, उसकी माँ बेहद हैरान थी कि नार्सीसस होने पर अगली सुबह वह वास्तव में कितना मजेदार सपना देख रही होगी। मैं जाग गया कि वह सब मुस्कुरा रही थी और यहाँ पर गिगल्स ने जानेमन को बताया कि तुमने क्या सपना देखा था। कल रात अच्छी तरह से माँ यह एक ऐसा अद्भुत सपना था जिसे आप जानते हैं कि यह राजकुमार था जो मेरे पास आया था। और कहा कि वह मुझसे शादी करना चाहता था, वह एक सुनहरी गाड़ी में आया था और उसने ऊपर से नीचे तक कपड़े पहने थे और सोने के साथ-साथ एक मूर्खतापूर्ण सपना भी था। और आप जानते हैं कि इसका सबसे अच्छा हिस्सा तब था जब मैं अपनी शादी की पोशाक में था, जो सोने का भी था, निश्चित रूप से हर कोई मुझे केवल नरसीसा घूर रहा था, उस सपने के बारे में कुछ भी आश्चर्यजनक नहीं है। यह एक बहुत ही अहंकारी स्वप्न था कि आप यह नहीं जानते कि आप यह कह रहे हैं कि स्वप्न ने मुझे यह एहसास दिलाया है कि मुझे सोने से बने घर की रोटी के प्रकार की तुलना में बहुत अधिक भोजन की आवश्यकता है। ज़रा सोचिए उस गरीब नशीली माँ को अपनी बेटी और उसकी चिंता कैसी थी। वह उस दिन अपना जीवन व्यतीत करेगी, जिस दिन दो दोस्त नार्सिसस मां से मिलने आए थे, वे मधुर थीं और टेरी उन तीनों की उम्र के लिए दोस्त थीं, लेकिन टेरी और एली दोनों का रहस्य था। जादुई प्राणी कुछ ऐसे थे कि नरसी की माँ को टेरी मेली के बारे में कुछ भी नहीं पता था, ओह, यह देखना बहुत अच्छा है कि यह आपको बहुत लंबा है। t यह कि आप कैसे हैं, मैं बहुत अच्छा हूं मैं बेहतर होता अगर केवल तभी अगर मेरी बेटी नार्सीसा केवल थोड़ी और समझ रखने वाली मर्दानी होती जो मेली और टेरी को नार्सीसा के बारे में सब बताती और वह उसके लिए चिंतित रहती कि वह क्या खाना चाहती है। सोने से बनी रोटी मैं उसके साथ क्या कर सकता हूँ अगर उसका सपना सच हो जाए। यह अद्भुत होगा यह अच्छी तरह से कोई फर्क नहीं पड़ता मैं समय में लगता है कि वह जानने के लिए बढ़ेगा चलो कुछ और के बारे में बात करते हैं। अब बाद में मैली और टेरी ने अपने पुराने दोस्त को अलविदा कह दिया और उस रात चुपके से एक दूसरे की माँ और बेटी दोनों के पास मुस्कुराते हुए चली गईं। बिस्तर माँ के लिए तैयार हो गया, मुझे आशा है कि मेरा सपना सच होगा, आप जानते हैं कि ओह नार्सीसा अगले दिन नार्किसा और उसकी माँ अपने बगीचे में एक सुंदर के बाहर थीं। सुनहरी गाड़ी उनके ऊपर सवार होकर आई थी, जो कि रत्नों और हीरों में जड़ी हुई थी और बेहद आश्चर्यजनक लग रही थी। जैसा कि इसने एक सुंदर आदमी को रोका, इससे बाहर आया और नरसीसा को देखा कि वह पूरी तरह से इस बात पर अचंभित था कि वह कितना सुंदर था, मेरा सपना वास्तव में सच था। मैं यहाँ शादी में नशा करने के लिए क्या कहने आया हूँ, लेकिन आप उसका नाम कैसे जानते हैं और आप कौन हैं। मैं बहुत खुश हूं कि आपकी बेटी का नाम और उसकी किस्मत अच्छी है और दुनिया भर में जाना जाता है। मैं आपके लिए एक ऐसा उपहार लेकर आया हूं, लेकिन आप शायद ही उसे जानते हों कि आप उसके साथ नहीं जा सकते। ओह मूर्खतापूर्ण वह अमीर और सुंदर है जो मैं चाहता हूं कि मैं आपके प्रस्ताव को स्वीकार कर सकता हूं। और इसके साथ ही वह अपनी गाड़ी में सवार हो गया और बिना अपनी माँ को अलविदा कहे परी के साथ सवार हो गया क्योंकि वे गाड़ी से जा रहे थे कि अचानक गाड़ी एक जादुई पोर्टल में घुस गई, वहाँ एक तूफानी क्षेत्र से गुज़री तो गाड़ी ने चारों ओर से जबरदस्त टक्कर मार दी। बहुत डर गया था कि मेरे प्रिय को यह सब चिंता नहीं होगी क्योंकि वह यह कहेगा कि यह गाड़ी एक अन्य पोर्टल से होकर ड्राइववे तक पहुँच जाएगी। एक विशाल और शानदार सुनहरे महल में नार्किसा ने सारी सुंदरता को देखकर आश्चर्यचकित कर दिया कि उसने देखा कि मैं जानता था कि मैं इतने सारे धनवानों के लायक हूँ, मुझे पता था कि आप इसे चाहते हैं कि आप कुछ भी चाहें, यहाँ आपको सबसे सुंदर कपड़े से लेकर सबसे स्वादिष्ट खाद्य पदार्थ मिलेंगे। मेरे महल में भोजन की अच्छी तरह से बोलना, मैं उस सवारी के बाद सच में भूखा हूँ ' मैं भूखा रह सकता हूँ, लेकिन यहाँ पर जो भी स्वादिष्ट मीट मिस्सा है वह आपको मिलेगा, जो भी आप चाहते हैं, उसके बारे में आपने बहुत सुना होगा। मैं तुम्हें कुछ खाना मिल जाएगा ओह, शुक्रिया, वे भोजन कक्ष में चले गए और मेज पर सबसे आश्चर्यजनक भोजन नार्सीसा कभी अद्भुत देखा था, क्योंकि यह जाम बना रहे हैं। माणिक के सलाद में पन्ना और वहां पर बनी रोटी सोने की सुनहरी रोटी से बनी होती है, यह जाम कितना प्यारा लगेगा और जिस रोटी के साथ उसने स्लाइस ली थी, वह बहुत ही अच्छी लगेगी। उस पर माणिक जाम और एक विशाल काट लिया यह इतना गर्म है मैं इसे अच्छी तरह से नहीं खा सकता यह रोटी सोने से बना है और बेहतरीन भी है लेकिन अगर आप इसे नहीं खा सकते हैं तो मुझे आपको चांदी की रोटी मिलनी चाहिए हुह क्यों नहीं तुम खाते हो। कुछ और लेकिन मुझे सामान्य ब्रेड रोटी चाहिए, जो मैं खा सकता हूं, इसलिए आपको ऐसा नहीं लगता कि मेरी पत्नी की शायरियां ऐसी हैं कि यह ठंडी है, आपको केवल सबसे अच्छा खाना चाहिए, जो सभी भोजन को देखते हुए एल है। लेकिन सब कुछ के लिए दिल टूटा हुआ था कि वह जल्द ही रोना शुरू कर दिया था मैं यह नहीं चाहता लेकिन खाना वास्तव में अच्छा है। यहाँ कुछ सुनहरे आलू आज़माएँ, जो वास्तव में अच्छे हैं और आप मुझसे शादी करने के बाद। आपको यह सब खाना होगा, मुझे लगा कि आपको फैंसी चीजें पसंद हैं नहीं, मैं आपसे शादी नहीं करना चाहता। मेरी माँ ने मुझे घर जाने दिया और मेलिस्सा ने एक दूसरे को देखा और अच्छी तरह से झांका। अगर तुम सच में चाहते हो तो मैं तुम्हें घर ले जाऊँगा, रोने और दुखी हो गया। गाड़ी में घर पर नशीली चीजें, जो उसने घर पहुंचते ही बनाई थी, के बारे में गहराई से सोचना शुरू कर दिया। वह अपनी माँ को गले लगाने के लिए दौड़ी, जो न तो घर में उदास बैठी थी और न ही बहन ओ मेरी प्यारी बेटी ने सोचा था कि मैं तुम्हें फिर कभी नहीं देख पाऊँगी। ओह मॉम आई लव यू सो मच और आप सही लग रहे थे और धन नहीं है सब कुछ सोने की रोटी बेकार थी क्योंकि मैं इसे और आदमी को खा नहीं सकता था। वह हैंडसम था, उसने मेरी बिल्कुल भी परवाह नहीं की, लेकिन मेरे प्यारे, क्या आपको पता है कि आपने दूसरों के साथ वैसा ही व्यवहार किया है, मुझे पता है कि जिस तरह से मैंने देखा है, ठीक उसी तरह से मैंने माँ के अभिनय के लिए खेद जताया है। आपकी गलती क्या थी आइए आपको उस दिन से कुछ अच्छा खिलाते हैं। narcisa ने अपने तरीके बदल दिए जिससे वह पहले तो संघर्ष करती रही लेकिन धीरे-धीरे और धैर्य से वह एक दिन बहुत अच्छी बनने लगी और एक दिन टेरी फिर से मियां से मिलने आई ओह हेल्लो तुम दो तो हमें मियां बताओ। किस तरह' s narcissism अब marian ने उन दोनों को वह सब कुछ बताया जो हुआ था और वह उस समय से बहुत बदल गया है। क्या मुझे लगता है कि वह अब और कोई सोने की रोटी नहीं चाहती है। टेरी आप वास्तव में उस परी की तरह थोड़ी दिखती हैं, हालांकि मैं क्या देख रही हूं कि आप कैसे हो सकते हैं कि आप दो इतने अच्छे हैं",Hindi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"oh mamá, te amo tanto y tenías razón, las apariencias y las riquezas no lo son todo, el pan de oro era inútil porque no podía comerlo y el hombre a pesar de todo él era guapo, no se preocupaba por mí en absoluto, pero querida, ¿te das cuenta de que esa es exactamente la forma en que trataste a los demás?",Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sé que lo siento mucho por la forma en que actué, mamá, oh, no, está bien desde que lo has visto.",Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"cuál fue tu error, vamos a darte de comer algo lindo a partir de ese día.",Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

θα είμαι καλά.,Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Εγώ' πάω στο πλυντήριο ούτως ή άλλως.,Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
δεν έχει σημασία αν θέλετε να ευχηθείτε σε κάποιον τύχη.,Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
και κάνω πάντα ότι μπορείτε να πείτε τα δάχτυλα σταυρωμένα και να διασχίζετε τα δάχτυλα έτσι.,Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
τα δάχτυλα διέσχισαν.,Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Μια άλλη φράση που χρησιμοποιούν οι Αμερικανοί είναι πολύ κακό που το εξηγεί και.,Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"η κατάσταση είναι ότι δεν πήρατε κάτι και στη συνέχεια έχετε ένα επιπλέον αποτέλεσμα, και το παίρνετε.",Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
και είσαι σαν αυτό που το εξηγεί που το εξηγεί.,Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ένας άλλος τρόπος να πείτε στο άτομο να μην είναι αναστατωμένος είναι ότι μπορείτε να πείτε ότι τα πράγματα συμβαίνουν όπως είναι εντάξει.,Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
τα πράγματα συμβαίνουν μην ανησυχείτε αν δεν έχετε το όνομα ενός ατόμου που θέλετε να του μιλήσετε.,Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"μπορείτε να πείτε συγνώμη που σας ενοχλεί, ξέρετε ότι βλέπετε.",Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"κάποιος είναι απασχολημένος, μπορείς πάντα να λες συγγνώμη που σε ενοχλεί και μετά μπορείς να προχωρήσεις και να ρωτήσεις.",Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

θα είμαι μαζί σου σε ένα λεπτό θα είμαι μαζί σου και μετά θα συνεχίσεις να κάνεις κάτι και θα πεις πού ήμασταν.,Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
όπως πότε σταματήσαμε που ήμασταν και πρέπει να το επαναλάβετε γιατί με τον ήχο που κάποιος κάποιος κάνει λάθος.,Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"οπότε αυτός είναι ένας πολύ καλός τρόπος για να εξασκηθείτε πού ήμασταν ξανά αν βρίσκεστε στη μέση μιας συνομιλίας; και δεν καταλάβατε αυτό που είπε το άλλο άτομο, μπορείτε να πείτε ότι λέγατε και με ερωτηματικό.",Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
που σημαίνει που ωθεί το άτομο να επαναλάβει ξανά; έλεγες .,Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"αν κάποιος πήρε δουλειά από τα όνειρά του για ό, τι μπορείτε να πείτε τυχερός, ή κάποιος μπήκε στο πανεπιστήμιο των ονείρων του σαν τυχερός, αυτός είναι ένας τρόπος για να συγχαρώ το τυχερό άτομο ή απλά να τονίσετε ότι είναι τυχερός τυχερός, άλλος τρόπος ότι είσαι πραγματικά θυμωμένος είναι να πεις ότι φοβόμουν σαν να ήμουν τόσο θυμωμένος.",Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ω, αυτό είναι σχεδόν τρελό.",Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"φρικάρω μια άλλη φράση που χρησιμοποιούν οι εγγενείς ομιλητές για εσάς και αυτό θα μπορούσε να είναι τόσο θετικό όσο και αρνητικό όταν λέτε ότι προωθήθηκα και αν λένε καλό για εσάς, όπως συγχαρητήρια και μερικές φορές αν λέτε ότι φεύγω από αυτό το μέρος.",Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"είναι σαν καλό για σένα θα ήταν καλύτερο χωρίς εσένα και αυτό είναι ένα αρνητικό νόημα, οπότε πραγματικά άκουσε τον τονισμό.",Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"αν κάτι σας εκπλήσσει, μπορείτε επίσης να πείτε ότι πρέπει να με αστειεύεσαι σαν θεέ μου.",Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Δεν μπορώ να το πιστέψω ότι πρέπει να μου αστειεύεσαι για να πεις σε κάποιον να χαμογελάσει και να είσαι ευτυχισμένος, μπορείς πάντα να πεις να πανηγυρίζεις.",Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"αν θέλετε κάποιος να ακούγεται σαν να κλαίει και να διαμαρτύρεται για κάτι που δεν συμβαίνει, μπορείτε να πείτε έλα, μπορείτε να το κάνετε; ελα.",Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
μπορείτε να το κάνετε μπορείτε να περάσετε το toefl μπορείτε να περάσετε το gmat που θα το πάρετε.,Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"μπορείτε να το κάνετε αν κάποιος κάνει πολύ καλά, μπορείτε να τους πείτε να συνεχίσουν την καλή δουλειά να συνεχίσουν την καλή δουλειά σαν να είναι τόσο καλή όσο είστε και να συνεχίσετε την καλή δουλειά να συνεχίσει να είναι μια άλλη φράση είναι συνηθισμένη, και αυτό είναι που οι Αμερικανοί λένε.",Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
αυτό είναι αναμμένο που σημαίνει ότι είναι εκπληκτικό πολλοί Αμερικανοί είπαν στην Καλιφόρνια.,Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ω είναι αναμμένο και μάλλον το έχετε ακούσει σε τραγούδια αναμμένο αν κάποιος είναι επιτυχής μετά από αποτυχίες, οπότε μπορείτε να πείτε ότι πηγαίνετε, σας είπα ότι θα το φτιάξετε εκεί, εάν κάποιος σας ρωτήσει αν είστε κουρασμένοι και θέλετε να πείτε ότι δεν είστε κουρασμένοι καθόλου μπορώ να πω όχι λίγο.",Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Θέλω να συνεχίσω δεν είμαι κουρασμένος από αυτό όταν κάποιος σας ρωτάει είστε σίγουροι και είστε πολύ σίγουροι ότι μπορείτε να πείτε ότι δεν υπάρχει χώρος για αυτό; δεν υπάρχει περιθώριο αμφιβολίας στην Αμερική αν θέλετε να στείλετε sms σε κάποιον ή να του στείλετε ένα μήνυμα που λέτε κείμενο σε κείμενο, οπότε θα σας στείλω κείμενο που σημαίνει ότι θα σας στείλω ένα μήνυμα μέσω WhatsApp ή ενός τηλεγραφήματος ή αγγελιοφόρου οτιδήποτε χρησιμοποιώ να σας στείλω ξανά μήνυμα για να ενθαρρύνεις κάποιον για να τους πεις να μην αναστατωθείς, μπορείς να πεις ότι δεν αξίζει τον κόπο, γιατί κλαις; δεν αξίζει τον κόπο.",Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"είσαι πολύ καλύτερος από το πρόβλημα που το κλαίνε "" δεν αξίζει τα δάκρυά σου.",Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ω Θεέ μου.,Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"λικνίζεις ροκ; όχι, έχετε κάνει μια καταπληκτική δουλειά.",Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"λικνίζεις αν κάποιος δεν δουλεύει πολύ καλά, και θέλεις να δουλέψει σκληρότερα, μπορείς να πεις ότι πρέπει να κάνεις ένα επιπλέον μίλι που σημαίνει σαν να δουλεύεις σκληρότερα πρέπει να κάνεις ένα επιπλέον μίλι.",Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ένας άλλος τρόπος για να πείτε το ίδιο πράγμα που μπορείτε να πείτε ανεβάζετε το παιχνίδι σας, όπως δουλέψτε σκληρότερα, βελτιώστε καλύτερα το παιχνίδι σας.",Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
αν κάποιος κλαίει και δεν το θέλει.,Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
βυθίζεται λέτε τραβήξτε τον εαυτό σας σαν κυριολεκτικά πάρτε τον εαυτό σας και τραβήξτε τον εαυτό σας σταματήστε να δουλεύετε σταματήστε να κλαίνε τραβήξτε τον εαυτό σας μαζί.,Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Γεια σου ηρεμήσεις μαζί μια άλλη φράση.,Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
μου αρέσει που με πούλησες γιατί μερικές φορές οι άνθρωποι περιγράφουν το ταξίδι τους ή κάποιον που αγόρασαν και το περιγράφουν ότι είναι τόσο καλά.,Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"και είναι σαν να θέλω να αγοράσω το ίδιο πράγμα και τους λέω ότι το πουλήσατε ότι με πουλήσατε, δεν θα το αγοράσω εντάξει, με πουλήσατε αν δεν σας ενδιαφέρει η συνομιλία.",Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"είστε σαν να κάθεστε, μπορείτε να πείτε ότι δεν με νοιάζει λιγότερο, αυτό είναι τόσο βαρετό.",Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Δεν με ενδιαφέρει.,Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"δεν θα με νοιαζόταν λιγότερο αν κάποιος σου ρωτάει κάτι και αυτή είναι μια πολύ εύκολη απόφαση για σένα, όπως κάποιος σου λέει ότι παίρνεις το 1 εκατομμύριο δολάρια μου και λέτε ότι αυτό δεν είναι μυαλό.",Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Θα το πάρω.,Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Αυτό είναι ένα μη-brainer σημαίνει ότι είναι μια πολύ εύκολη απόφαση για εσάς αν έχετε κάνει κάτι λάθος και το παραδέχεστε ότι μπορείτε να πείτε ότι έκανα ναι παιδιά.,Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ξέρω.,Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

αυτό είναι το λάθος μου.,Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

μπορείς να με καλύψεις όπως μπορείς να δουλέψεις αντί για μένα ενώ εγώ βλέπω τον φίλο μου.,Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"μπορείς να με καλύψεις ήρθε η ώρα να φύγω και παιδιά καλύτερα να πάω, πράγμα που σημαίνει ότι πρέπει να φύγω ήδη.",Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Είμαι πολύ χαρούμενος που ήταν παιδιά 50 φράσεις στα αγγλικά, επιτρέψτε μου να μάθω αν αυτό ήταν χρήσιμο αν μου άρεσε αυτό το βίντεο και σχολιάζοντας παρακάτω, εάν γνωρίζετε περισσότερες δροσερές φράσεις.",Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

το χρυσό ψωμί κάποτε σε ένα μικρό χωριό ζούσε μια γυναίκα που ονομάζεται μαριόν.,Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"με τη μοναδική κόρη της, η νάρκισσα, η μαρίνα ήταν εξαιρετικά ταπεινή και γλυκιά ναρκίσσα, ωστόσο ήταν εντελώς το αντίθετο που βλέπεις ότι ήταν όμορφη πέρα ​​από τα λόγια που ήταν σαν ένα ζωντανό.",Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
κούκλα και το πιο διασκεδαστικό είναι ότι αγαπούσε τον εαυτό της χωρίς ναρκίσσα θα θέλατε.,Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"βοήθησέ με να ψήσω το ψωμί, έτσι κι αλλιώς μαμά το αλεύρι υπηρέτησε όλα τα φωτεινά και φωτεινά μάτια μου narcisa θα με βοηθούσες να φυτέψω αυτούς τους σπόρους, γιατί γιατί θα έκανα αυτό που έχω όλη αυτή τη βρωμιά στα υπέροχα δάχτυλά μου χειρότερα, αν πήγε καλά στο πρόσωπό μου, αυτό ήταν το πρόβλημα με τη ναρκίσσα.",Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"πίστευε ότι ήταν πολύ μεγάλη για να κάνει οποιαδήποτε δουλειά, πολλοί μνηστήρες ήρθαν να ζητήσουν να πάρουν ναρκίσσους.",Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"δεδομένου ότι η ομορφιά της ήταν γνωστή πολύ μακριά, αλλά τους απέρριψε όλα πολύ αγενή γιατί έστειλε εκείνους τους άντρες χθες φαινόταν ωραία δεν μπορείς να είσαι σοβαρή μαμά, ένας από αυτούς.",Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
είχα τόσο μικρά μάτια σχεδόν σαν πουλί και το άλλο είχε μια τεράστια μύτη που δεν θα ήθελα να είμαι κοντά του.,Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"όταν φταρνίστηκε ω και η τελευταία στάση όχι δεν θέλω να ακούσω πια το μόνο που μπορούσα να δω ήταν ότι αυτοί οι άντρες ήταν πολύ καλοί, αγαπητέ μου, πρέπει να ξέρετε αυτή την ομορφιά.",Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
δεν είναι όλα όσα πρέπει να συνειδητοποιήσετε ότι αξίζω κάποιον σαν πρίγκιπας ή ιππότης.,Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ω αγαπητή μια νύχτα όταν κοιμόταν η μητέρα της κάθισε στο πλάι της παρακολουθώντας την.,Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
αγαπητέ μου παιδί είσαι τόσο όμορφη και υπέροχη αλλά δεν νοιάζεσαι τίποτα άλλο από την ομορφιά σου.,Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"εκείνη τη στιγμή ο νάρκισσος άρχισε να γελάει στον ύπνο της, η μητέρα της εξέπληξε πόσο ωραία πρέπει να έχει ένα πραγματικά αστείο όνειρο το επόμενο πρωί όταν ο νάρκισσος.",Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ξύπνησα ότι ήταν όλα χαμόγελα και γέλια εδώ γλυκιά μου να μου πει τι ονειρευόσασταν.,Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
χθες το βράδυ μαμά ήταν ένα τόσο υπέροχο όνειρο που ξέρεις ότι υπήρχε αυτός ο πρίγκιπας που ήρθε σε μένα.,Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"και είπε ότι ήθελε να με παντρευτεί, είχε έρθει σε μια χρυσή άμαξα και ήταν ντυμένος από πάνω προς τα κάτω και χρυσός, επίσης, τι ανόητο όνειρο.",Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
και ξέρεις ότι το καλύτερο ήταν όταν ήμουν στο νυφικό μου που ήταν από χρυσό και φυσικά όλοι με κοίταζαν μόνο ναρκίσσα δεν υπάρχει τίποτα καταπληκτικό για αυτό το όνειρο.,Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ήταν μια πολύ εγωιστική ονειρεμένη μαμά που δεν ξέρεις τι λες ότι το όνειρο με έκανε να συνειδητοποιήσω ότι χρειάζομαι φαγητό πολύ μεγαλύτερο από τον τύπο που τρώω εδώ στο σπίτι ψωμί από χρυσό.,Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
απλά σκεφτείτε ότι η φτωχή μητέρα του ναρκίσσου ανησυχούσε τόσο πολύ για την κόρη της και πώς.,Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"θα ζούσε τη ζωή της εκείνη την ημέρα δύο φίλοι ήρθαν να επισκεφτούν τη μητέρα του ναρκίσσου που ήταν mellie και ο Terry οι τρεις τους ήταν φίλοι για αιώνες, αλλά η Terry και η Έλλη είχαν ένα μυστικό και οι δύο.",Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ήταν μαγικά όντα κάτι που η μητέρα της ναρκίσσας δεν γνώριζε τίποτα για τον Terry Melli, είναι τόσο καλό να σε βλέπω που ήταν πολύ καιρό πώς είσαι, ήμουν πολύ καλός, θα ήμουν καλύτερα αν μόνο αν και μόνο αν η κόρη μου η ναρκίσσα ήταν λίγο πιο κατανοητή, η μαριάν είπε στην Mellie και τον Terry τα πάντα για τη ναρκίσσα και πώς ανησυχούσε γι 'αυτήν που θέλει να φάει ψωμί από χρυσό τι να κάνω μαζί της, ίσως αν το όνειρό της γίνει πραγματικότητα.",Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"αυτό θα ήταν υπέροχο, δεν θα είχε σημασία αν υποθέτω ότι θα μεγαλώσει για να μάθει ας μιλήσουμε για κάτι άλλο.",Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"τώρα αργότερα η Μέλι και ο Τέρι έσπασαν αντίο στον παλιό τους φίλο και πήγαν να χαμογελούν ο ένας στον άλλο κρυφά εκείνο το βράδυ, τόσο μητέρα όσο και κόρη.",Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ετοιμάστηκα για το κρεβάτι της μητέρας, πραγματικά ελπίζω να γίνει πραγματικότητα το όνειρό μου, ξέρετε ω ναρκίσσα την επόμενη μέρα, καθώς η ναρκίσσα και η μητέρα της ήταν έξω στον κήπο τους μια όμορφη.",Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Χρυσή άμαξα ήρθε πάνω τους, ήταν γεμάτη με πολύτιμους λίθους και διαμάντια και φαινόταν εξαιρετικά εκπληκτική.",Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"καθώς σταμάτησε ένας όμορφος άντρας βγήκε από αυτό και κοίταξε τη νάρκισσα, ήταν εντελώς ξαφνιασμένος με το πόσο όμορφος ήταν το όνειρό μου, στην πραγματικότητα γίνεται πραγματικότητα.",Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"τι γεια σας ήρθα εδώ για να ζητήσω να νάρκισσος παραδώσει το γάμο, αλλά πώς ξέρετε το όνομά της και ποιος είστε.",Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Είμαι ο άγγελος της καλής τύχης, το όνομα και η ομορφιά της κόρης σας είναι γνωστό σε όλο τον κόσμο εδώ, σας έφερα ένα δώρο, αλλά σχεδόν δεν τον γνωρίζετε ότι δεν μπορείτε να πάτε μαζί του.",Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ω, ανόητος είναι πλούσιος και όμορφος, τι περισσότερο θα ήθελα να έχω έδαφος, αποδέχομαι την πρότασή σας.",Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"και με αυτό μπήκε στο καροτσάκι του και χωρίς καν να αποχαιρετήσει τη μητέρα της, έφυγε με τον άγγελο καθώς ταξίδευαν το άμαξα ξαφνικά μπήκε σε μια μαγική πύλη εκεί που ταξίδεψε μέσα από μια θυελλώδη περιοχή, η άμαξα έπεσε τρομερά και ναρκίσσα.",Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ήταν πολύ φοβισμένος, μην ανησυχείτε, αγαπητέ μου, όλα αυτά σύντομα θα τελειώσουν ακριβώς όπως είπε ότι η μεταφορά περνούσε από μια άλλη πύλη και έφτασε στο δρόμο.",Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"από ένα τεράστιο και υπέροχο χρυσό κάστρο Νάρκισα ήταν έκπληκτος με όλη την ομορφιά που είδε, ήξερα ότι αξίζω τόσα πολλά πλούτη, ήξερα ότι θα θέλατε ό, τι θέλετε θα βρείτε εδώ από τα πιο όμορφα φορέματα έως τα πιο νόστιμα φαγητά όλα αυτά στο παλάτι μου μιλώντας καλά για φαγητό είμαι πολύ πεινασμένος μετά από αυτήν τη βόλτα Πεινασμένος μπορώ να έχω κάποιο από αυτά τα νόστιμα φαγητά, φυσικά εδώ κρέας μυρωδιά μέλισσα που θα σας πάρει ό, τι θέλετε, σας έχω ακούσει τόσα πολλά για εσάς, φτωχοί αγαπητοί, πεινάτε, δεν έρχεστε, πάμε στο τραπέζι θα σου φέρω λίγο φαγητό, ευχαριστώ που πήγαν στην τραπεζαρία και εκεί στο τραπέζι ήταν το πιο εκπληκτικό φαγητό που είχε δει η νάρκισα ποτέ καταπληκτική, διότι είναι φτιαγμένες οι μαρμελάδες.",Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
από ρουμπίνια οι σαλάτες από σμαράγδια και το ψωμί εκεί είναι φτιαγμένο από χρυσό χρυσό ψωμί πόσο υπέροχη θα φαίνεται αυτή η μαρμελάδα και θα έχει υπέροχη γεύση με το ψωμί που πήρε μια φέτα με το.,Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ρουμπίνι μαρμελάδα σε αυτό και πήρε ένα τεράστιο δάγκωμα αυτό είναι τόσο ζεστό δεν μπορώ να το φάω καλά, είναι ψωμί από χρυσό και το καλύτερο, αλλά αν δεν μπορείτε να το φάτε θα σας πάρω ασημένιο ψωμί ασημί, γιατί να μην το κάνετε τρως.",Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"κάτι άλλο, αλλά θέλω κανονικό ψωμί ψωμί το οποίο μπορώ να φάω, δεν έχεις αυτή την εμφάνιση, έτσι η σύζυγος του κοχύλι μου είναι κρύο, πρέπει να φάτε μόνο τα καλύτερα ναρκίσια που κοίταξα όλα τα φαγητά.",Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"αλλά ήταν σπασμένη για ό, τι ήταν βρώσιμο, σύντομα άρχισε να κλαίει δεν το θέλω αυτό, αλλά το φαγητό είναι πολύ καλό.",Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
εδώ δοκιμάστε μερικές χρυσές πατάτες που είναι πραγματικά καλές και αφού είστε παντρεμένοι με εμένα.,Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"θα πρέπει να φάτε όλα αυτά, νόμιζα ότι σας άρεσαν φανταχτερά πράγματα όχι, δεν θέλω να σας παντρευτώ, θέλω να πάω σπίτι.",Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"στη μητέρα μου άφησέ με να πάει σπίτι, η μέλισσα και ο τερενς κοίταξε ο ένας τον άλλον και το μάτι καλά.",Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"αν αυτό είναι πραγματικά αυτό που θέλεις, τότε θα σε πάω σπίτι, το terrence πήρε το κλάμα και δυστυχισμένο.",Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
narcis στο σπίτι της άμαξας άρχισε να σκέφτεται βαθιά για τις επιλογές που είχε κάνει όταν έφτασε στο σπίτι.,Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"έτρεξε να αγκαλιάσει τη μητέρα της που καθόταν στο σπίτι λυπημένη ούτε αδερφή της γλυκιάς μου κόρης, νόμιζα ότι δεν θα σε ξαναδώ.",Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ω μαμά σ 'αγαπώ τόσο πολύ και είσαι σωστή εμφάνιση και ο πλούτος δεν είναι όλα όσα το χρυσό ψωμί ήταν άχρηστο καθώς δεν μπορούσα να το φάω και ο άντρας.,Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ήταν όμορφος, δεν με νοιάζει καθόλου, αλλά αγαπητή μου, συνειδητοποιείς ότι είναι ακριβώς ο τρόπος με τον οποίο φέρεσαι στους άλλους, ξέρω ότι λυπάμαι πολύ για τον τρόπο με τον οποίο ενήργησα η μαμά, όχι, είναι εντάξει από τότε που είδατε.",Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"τι ήρθε το λάθος σου, ας σου δώσουμε κάτι ωραίο από εκείνη τη μέρα και μετά.",Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Η ναρκίσσα άλλαξε τους τρόπους της που αγωνίστηκε στην αρχή αλλά αργά και υπομονετικά άρχισε να γίνεται πολύ πιο όμορφη μια μέρα η Μέλι και ο Τέρρι ήρθε να συναντήσει ξανά τη Μαρία, γεια σας, λοιπόν, πείτε μας τη Μαρία.",Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"πως' Ο ναρκισσισμός, τώρα η Μαρία, τους είπε όλα όσα είχαν συμβεί και έχει αλλάξει τόσο πολύ από τότε.",Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Μήπως υποθέτω ότι δεν θα ήθελε άλλο χρυσό ψωμί τώρα, έτσι ξέρεις.",Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Terry, στην πραγματικότητα μοιάζεις λίγο με αυτόν τον άγγελο, αλλά αυτό που βλέπω πώς θα μπορούσες να είσαι εσύ και οι δύο είναι τόσο καλοί",Greek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Nature (в переводе с англ.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
— «Природа») — один из самых старых и авторитетных общенаучных журналов.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Публикует исследования, посвящённые широкому кругу вопросов, в основном естественно-научной тематики.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Первый номер журнала Nature был издан 4 ноября 1869 года английским физиком сэром Джозефом Норманом Локьером, который оставался редактором журнала до 1919 года.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nature редактируется в Великобритании издательством Nature Publishing Group и издаётся в Лондоне.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"У журнала есть также офисы в Нью-Йорке, Сан-Франциско, Вашингтоне, Токио, Париже, Мюнхене и Бейзингстоке.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Журнал ориентирован на научных работников, однако в начале каждого издания публикуется краткое популярное изложение важнейших публикаций.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
В колонке редактора и разделе «Новости» (англ.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"News Articles) сообщается о событиях, интересных специалистам во всех областях.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Остальная часть журнала состоит из оригинальных исследований, предполагающих наличие у читателя специальных знаний в соответствующей области.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"С 2005 года журнал публикует подкасты, где вкратце обсуждаются достижения науки и публикации за последнюю неделю — две.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[3][4] Публикации в таких журналах, как Nature или Science, крайне престижны, так как статьи из них часто цитируются, а автор получает широкую известность и за пределами своей области науки.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Так, импакт-фактор Nature в 2012 году был равен 38,597[5], то есть каждая статья за два года, прошедших после публикации, в среднем цитируется более 38 раз.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
В 2009 году вошёл в Список 100 самых влиятельных журналов биологии и медицины за последние 100 лет под № 1 и был назван Журналом Столетия.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Однако критерии отбора статей в Nature (как и в Science) чрезвычайно жёстки.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Большинство направляемых в Nature статей отсеиваются ещё до стадии рецензирования, поскольку результаты исследований, описанные в предлагаемой к публикации статье, должны представлять существенное продвижение в той или иной области науки.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Так, именно в Nature были опубликованы статьи: В 2009 году 3 из 5 самых цитируемых в мире статей по биологии были напечатаны в журнале Nature[7].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Нобелевский лауреат по медицине 2013 года Рэнди Шекман при вручении ему премии заявил, что ведущие научные журналы, среди которых и Nature, мешают научному процессу, так как желание увидеть свою публикацию в ведущих журналах побуждает учёных «срезать углы» и заниматься тем, что считается модным, а не тем, что важнее для науки.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Кроме того, по мнению Шекмана, проблема в том, что редакторы этих журналов являются не учёными, а издателями и их интересуют прежде всего шумиха, сенсация и фурор.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Он пообещал больше не отправлять свои статьи в журналы Nature, Cell и Science.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[8] Академик РАН Е. Д. Свердлов, кроме случая с Шекманом, также обращает внимание на инцидент с японскими учёными из Центра биологии развития Института физико-химических исследований (RIKEN), опубликовавшими в 2014 году в журнале две статьи с изложением итогов опытов над зрелыми клетками мышей, подвергавшихся различному роду стрессовых воздействий, включая погружение в кислоту — метод, получивший известность под названием «получение плюрипотентности, вызванной стимулом (англ.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
)русск.» (англ.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"stimulus-triggered acquisition of pluripotency, STAP), в ходе которых ими был обнаружен новейший способ преобразования клеток в эмбрионально-подобное (плюрипотентное) состояние.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Данное исследование первоначально было высоко оценено мировым научным сообществом, поскольку являлось теоретическим и медицинским открытием и позволяло упростить получение стволовых клеток необходимых для пересадки.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Однако в дальнейшем в ходе внутреннего расследования RIKEN было обнаружено, что Харуко Обоката, являвшаяся ключевым лицом в группе исследователей, совершила крупный подлог с фотографиями и рисунками.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Следствием этого стал отзыв публикаций и самоубийство научного руководителя исследования Ёсики Сасаи, решившегося на это чтобы сохранить лицо.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[9] В 2018 году группа исследователей из США, Швеции, Новой Зеландии, Сингапура, Германии, Нидерландов и Китая под руководством психолога Б. Нозека (англ.)",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"повторила эксперименты по общественным наукам, результаты которых были опубликованы в журналах Science и Nature в 2010—2015 годах, и выяснила, что из 21 эксперимента только 13 (62 %) прошли проверку на воспроизводимость[10][11].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Википе́дия (англ.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Wikipedia, произносится [ˌwɪkɨˈpiːdiə] или [ˌwɪkiˈpiːdiə]) — общедоступная многоязычная универсальная интернет-энциклопедия со свободным контентом[комм.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2], реализованная на принципах вики.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Расположена по адресу wikipedia.org.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Владелец сайта — американская некоммерческая организация «Фонд Викимедиа», имеющая 37 региональных представительств.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Название энциклопедии образовано от английских слов wiki («вики»; в свою очередь заимствовано из гавайского языка, в котором оно имеет значение «быстро») и encyclopedia («энциклопедия»).",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Запущенная в январе 2001 года Джимми Уэйлсом и Ларри Сэнгером[7], Википедия сейчас является самым крупным и наиболее популярным[8] справочником в Интернете[9][10][11].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
По объёму сведений и тематическому охвату Википедия считается самой полной энциклопедией из когда-либо создававшихся за всю историю человечества[12][13].,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Одним из основных достоинств Википедии как универсальной энциклопедии является возможность представления информации на родном языке пользователя[14].,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"На май 2018 года разделы Википедии есть на 301 языке, а также на 493 языках в инкубаторе.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Она содержит более 40 миллионов[1] статей.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Интернет-сайт Википедии является пятым по посещаемости сайтом в мире[15].,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Главной особенностью Википедии является то, что создавать и редактировать статьи в ней может любой пользователь Интернета[комм.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3].,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Все вносимые такими добровольцами изменения незамедлительно становятся доступными для просмотра всем посетителям сайта.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"В декабре 2013 года в заявлении ЮНЕСКО по случаю награждения Джимми Уэйлса, основателя Википедии, Золотой медалью Нильса Бора про Википедию было сказано, что она является «символом эпохи взаимодействия, в которую мы живём, и это не просто инструмент, это воплощение мечты, столь же древней, как человеческий интеллект и собрания Александрийской библиотеки»[16][17].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Надёжность и точность Википедии вызывают вопросы[18].,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Википедию критикуют за возможность добавления ложной или непроверенной информации[19] и вандализма на её страницах.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Однако научные исследования свидетельствуют о том, что в Википедии следы актов вандализма обычно оперативно устраняются[20][21].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Раздел Википедии на русском языке на 28 июня 2020 года занимает 7-е место по количеству статей среди всех языковых разделов.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"В отличие от традиционных энциклопедий, таких, как Encyclopædia Britannica, ни одна статья в Википедии не проходит формального процесса экспертной оценки.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Любая статья Википедии может редактироваться как с учётной записи участника, так даже и без регистрации на проекте (за исключением некоторых страниц, подверженных частому вандализму, которые доступны для изменения только определённым категориям участников или, в крайних случаях, только администраторам Википедии), и при этом все внесённые в статью изменения незамедлительно становятся доступными для просмотра любыми пользователями.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Поэтому Википедия «не гарантирует истинность» своего содержимого[22], ведь в любом случае между моментом, когда в статью будет внесена какая-то недостоверная информация, и моментом, когда эта информация будет удалена из статьи другим участником Википедии (более компетентным в данной области знания), пройдёт определённое время.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(Естественно, для того, чтобы обнаружить и удалить из статьи явный вандализм, нужно намного меньше времени, чем для того, чтобы освободить статью от недостоверной информации, когда подобная недостоверность не является особо очевидной.)",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Содержимое Википедии подпадает под действие законов (в частности, авторского права) штата Вирджиния в США, где находятся серверы Википедии, и нескольких редакционных политик и руководств, которые призваны укрепить идею о том, что Википедия является энциклопедией.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Каждый вклад в Википедию должен быть по теме, являющейся энциклопедической.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Тема считается энциклопедической, если она является «значимой»[23] на жаргоне Википедии, то есть если она получила значительное освещение во вторичных авторитетных источниках (например в центральных СМИ или серьёзных научных журналах), которые являются независимыми от предмета темы.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"В Википедии должна отражаться информация, которая уже установлена и признана[24].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Иными словами, статья не должна быть «площадкой» для размещения чьих бы то ни было собственных идей, теорий, исследований, изобретений, личных мнений, оценок чего бы то ни было, искусствоведческой критики и т. п. Информация в статьях, которая, скорее всего, будет поставлена под сомнение, требует ссылок на авторитетные источники.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Сообщество Википедии сформулировало это как «проверяемость, а не истина», выражая тем самым ту мысль, что читателям предоставляется возможность самим проверить истинность той информации, которая представлена в статьях, и сделать свои собственные выводы[25].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Википедия не становится на чью-либо сторону[26].,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"В рамках статьи Википедии все мнения и точки зрения должны иметь соответствующую долю освещения по данному вопросу, если они имеют свои подтверждения во внешних источниках[27].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Все участники, зарегистрированы они на проекте или нет, могут пользоваться функциями программного обеспечения, на котором работает Википедия.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Так, на странице «История», прилагающейся к каждой статье Википедии, доступны записи каждой предыдущей редакции статьи (версии с угрозами криминального характера, нарушениями авторских прав и т. п. могут быть скрыты от просмотра[комм.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4]).,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Эта функция позволяет легко сравнить нынешнюю и более старые версии статьи, отменить изменения («откатить статью»), которые участник посчитает неверными, или восстановить потерянное содержимое.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Страница «Обсуждение», прилагающаяся к каждой статье Википедии, используется в целях координации работы над текстом этой статьи между разными участниками проекта[28].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Постоянные участники нередко используют «Список наблюдения», в который заносят интересные для себя статьи и, таким образом, могут легко отслеживать все недавние изменения в этих статьях.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Компьютерные программы, называемые ботами, в Википедии широко используются для удаления вандализма, как только он был произведён[21], а также для исправления общих ошибок и стилистических проблем или создания статей, например, о географических объектах или биологических видах в стандартном формате из статистических данных.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Википедия началась как дополнительный проект для «Нупедии» — бесплатного англоязычного энциклопедического онлайн-проекта, чьи статьи были написаны специалистами и рецензированы в рамках формального процесса.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"«Нупедия» была основана 9 марта 2000 года как собственность Bomis, Inc. — компании, владеющей одноимённым веб-порталом.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ключевыми фигурами были Джимми Уэйлс, CEO Bomis и Ларри Сэнгер, главный редактор «Нупедии», а затем Википедии.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"«Нупедия», первоначально лицензированная в соответствии со своей лицензией Nupedia Open Content License, перешла на GNU Free Documentation License перед основанием Википедии по настоянию Ричарда Столлмана[29].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Основатели Википедии — Ларри Сэнгер и Джимми Уэйлс[30][31].,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"В то время как Уэйлсу приписывается определение цели создания публично редактируемой энциклопедии[32][33], Сэнгеру обычно приписывают контринтуитивную стратегию использования вики для достижения этой цели[34].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"10 января 2001 года Ларри Сэнгер в списке рассылки «Нупедии» предложил применить концепцию «вики» в отношении «Нупедии»[35], чтобы ускорить её развитие.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Это привело к созданию веб-сайта Википедии, которая изначально задумывалась для предварительной разработки материалов, которые потом были бы размещены в «Нупедии».",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Название «Википедия» также было предложено Ларри Сэнгером[31].,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Википедия была официально открыта 15 января 2001 года как одиночный англоязычный раздел на www.wikipedia.com[36] и была анонсирована Сэнгером в списке рассылки «Нупедии»[32].,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Политика «нейтральной точки зрения» в Википедии[37] была введена в первые месяцы и была аналогична ранней политике «непредубеждения» в «Нупедии».,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"В других отношениях, первоначально существовало относительно немного правил, и Википедия управлялась независимо от «Нупедии»[32].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Википедия получила ранних участников из «Нупедии», сообщений на Slashdot и за счёт индексации поисковыми машинами.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Она выросла до примерно 20 000 статей и 18 языковых разделов к концу 2001 года.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"К концу 2002 года она достигла 26 языковых разделов, 46 к концу 2003 года и 161 к последним дням 2004 года[38].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"«Нупедия» и Википедия сосуществовали, пока серверы первой не были навсегда отключены в 2003 году (текст «Нупедии» был включён в Википедию).",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Английская Википедия прошла отметку в 2 млн статей 9 сентября 2007 года, что делает её крупнейшей энциклопедией, собравшей всё и затмившей даже энциклопедию Юнлэ (1407), которая держала рекорд ровно 600 лет[39].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ссылаясь на опасения по поводу коммерческой рекламы и отсутствие контроля в осознанном англоцентризме Википедии, пользователи испанской Википедии выделились из Википедии для создания Enciclopedia Libre в феврале 2002 года[40].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Позднее в том же году Уэйлс объявил о том, что Википедия не будет отображать рекламу, и её веб-сайт был перемещён на wikipedia.org[41].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Некоторые другие проекты выделились из Википедии по редакционным причинам.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wikinfo не требует нейтральной точки зрения и разрешает оригинальные исследования.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Новые проекты, вдохновлённые Википедией, — такие, как Citizendium, Scholarpedia, Conservapedia и Google Knol[42], — были начаты в ответ на осознание ограничений Википедии, таких, как политика в области рецензирования, оригинальных исследований и коммерческой рекламы.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Фонд Викимедиа (англ.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wikimedia Foundation) был создан из Википедии и «Нупедии» 20 июня 2003 года[43].,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Он использовался в United States Patent and Trademark Office для регистрации товарного знака «Wikipedia» 17 сентября 2004 года.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10 января 2006 года знаку был предоставлен зарегистрированный статус.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"16 декабря 2004 года товарный знак получил защиту со стороны Японии, 20 января 2005 года — в Европейском союзе.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Существуют планы лицензирования торговой марки Википедии для некоторых продуктов, таких, как книги и DVD[44].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
В ноябре 2015 года Википедия получила Премию Эразма[45].,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Пользователи Википедии — это: Участники Википедии образуют сообщество участников Википедии.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Структура этого сообщества — иерархическая, то есть это своего рода структура власти[46][47].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Участники Википедии с хорошей репутацией в сообществе могут баллотироваться на один из многих уровней добровольного руководства; это начинается с «администратора»[48], самой большой группы привилегированных пользователей (1594 учётных записей в английской Википедии, по состоянию на 30 сентября 2008 года), которые имеют возможность удаления страниц, блокировки статей от изменений в случае вандализма или редакторских споров и блокировки участников.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Несмотря на название, администраторы не имеют никаких особенных привилегий в процессе принятия решений, и им запрещено использовать свои полномочия для урегулирования споров.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Роли администраторов часто описываются как «уборка» и в основном ограничиваются внесением правок, имеющих эффект в масштабах всего проекта (и поэтому запрещённых для обычных редакторов, чтобы минимизировать нарушения), а также блокировкой пользователей для предотвращения разрушительных правок, таких как вандализм.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Поскольку Википедия развивается на основе нетрадиционной модели составления энциклопедии, вопрос «Кто пишет „Википедию“?» стал одним из наиболее часто задаваемых вопросов по проекту, часто со ссылкой на другие проекты Веб 2.0, такие как Digg[49] или, например, News2 и Хабрахабр.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Джимми Уэйлс однажды утверждал, что только «сообщество… преданная группа нескольких сотен добровольцев» делает основной вклад в Википедию и что этот проект является поэтому «очень похожим на любую традиционную организацию».",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Это было позже оспорено Аароном Шварцем, который отметил, что ряд просмотренных им статей имели крупные части содержания, внесёнными участниками с малым количеством правок[50].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Исследование учёных из Дартмутского колледжа, проведённое в 2007 году, установило, что анонимы и те пользователи, которые редко делают вклад в Википедию, являются таким же надёжным источником знаний, как и те, которые зарегистрированы на сайте[51].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Хотя некоторые участники сильны в своей области, Википедия требует, чтобы даже их вклады были подкреплены опубликованными и поддающимися проверке источниками.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Это предпочтение консенсуса наличию образования было отмечено как «антиэлитарность»[52].,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"В августе 2007 года сайт, разработанный аспирантом по компьютерным наукам Вирджилом Гриффитом и названный WikiScanner, начал публичное функционирование.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"WikiScanner прослеживает источники миллионов изменений, произведённых в Википедии анонимными редакторами, и показывает, что многие из этих правок делаются из корпораций или правительственных учреждений в статьях, связанных с ними, их персоналом или их работой, из которых они пытаются удалить критику[53].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"В 2003 году в исследовании о Википедии как о сообществе студент  Andrea Ciffolilli утверждал, что низкие операционные затраты участия в вики создают катализатор для совместного развития и что подход «творческого развития» поощряет участие[54].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"В своей книге «Будущее Интернета и как его остановить» 2008 года Jonathan Zittrain из Оксфордского института Интернета и Berkman Center for Internet & Society Гарвардской школы права ссылается на Википедию как социологическое исследование в том, как открытое сотрудничество способствовало инноваторству в Сети[55].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"В 2007 году исследователь Одед Нов опубликовал работу о мотивации, которой руководствуются википедисты.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Нов считает, что участники редактируют Википедию, исходя из следующих видов мотивации: защитной («когда я правлю „Википедию“, я чувствую себя не так одиноко»), желание внести вклад в общее дело («мне кажется, важно помогать другим»), мотивации карьеры («я могу получить новые контакты, которые могут помочь в моём бизнесе или карьере»), социальной, познавательной («написание „Википедии“ позволяет мне взглянуть на вещи по-новому»), желание быть кому-то нужным («когда я правлю „Википедию“, я чувствую себя востребованным»), потребность в положительных эмоциях («писать/править „Википедию“ — это весело»), идеологической[56].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"На 30 июня 2015 года существует 290 языковых разделов Википедии, из них 51 раздел содержит более 100 000 статей, а 237 — более 1000 статей[57].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Посещаемость разделов изменяется со временем.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
К октябрю 2009 года русская Википедия вышла на 5-ю позицию в списке посещаемости.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
По состоянию на август 2013 года русская Википедия находилась на 4-м месте.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Первые 5 разделов в это время имели следующий процент посещений, от общего числа: английская — 60,7 %; испанская — 7,8 %; немецкая — 6,7 %; русская — 6,0 %; японская — 5,8 %[58].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Википедия является сетевой энциклопедией, поэтому участники одного и того же языкового раздела могут использовать различные диалекты и могут быть из разных стран (как в случае с английским разделом).",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Эти различия могут привести к некоторым конфликтам из-за различного написания слов (например color vs. colour)[59] или точек зрения[60].,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Несмотря на то, что различные языковые разделы придерживаются глобальной политики, такой как нейтральная точка зрения, они расходятся по некоторым вопросам политики и практики, особенно по вопросу, могут ли изображения, которые не лицензируются по свободной лицензии, использоваться согласно требованиям добросовестного использования[61][62][63].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Джимми Уэйлс описал Википедию как «усилия по созданию и распространению свободной энциклопедии самого высокого качества для каждого человека на планете на его собственном языке»[64].,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Несмотря на то, что функционирование каждого языкового раздела более или менее самостоятельно, предприняты некоторые усилия для контроля всех разделов.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Они координируются частично Мета-вики, вики Фонда Викимедиа, посвящённой поддержанию всех его проектов (Википедия и др.).",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Например, Мета-вики предоставляет важную статистику всех языковых разделов Википедии и поддерживает список статей, которые должны быть во всех Википедиях.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Список касается основного содержания таких предметов, как биография, история, география, общество, культура, наука, технология, продовольствие и математика.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Что касается остального, то нередко для статей, тесно связанных с конкретным языком, нет копии в другом разделе.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Например, статьи о малых городах США могут быть доступны только на английском.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Переводные статьи представляют лишь небольшую долю статей в большинстве разделов, в частности потому, что автоматизированный перевод статей не разрешён[65].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Статьи, доступные более чем на одном языке, могут иметь «интервики»-ссылки, которые связывают статьи с их копиями в других разделах.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Википедия не лишена недостатков.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Прежде всего информация, тексты Википедии объективно подвержены системным отклонениям.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Другими основными объектами критики Википедии являются: Критики Википедии указывают на то, что участники Википедии совместно пишут и пересматривают её правила, политики и руководства[67], а затем, зачастую чисто формально и очень негибко их придерживаясь, удаляют, аннотируя тегами комментариев, или изменяют материалы статей, формально не отвечающие этим правилам, политикам и руководствам (см.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
также Википедия:Удализм и Википедия:Инклюзионизм[68][69]).,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Сообщество Википедии было также описано как «подобное культу»[70], хотя и не всегда с исключительно негативной коннотацией[71] и было раскритиковано за неспособность привлечь неопытных пользователей к работе в проекте[72].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Также критики Википедии обращают внимание на системную предвзятость, несбалансированность в освещении тем[52], а также критикуют её политику предпочтения консенсуса между участниками профессионализму отдельных участников в редакционном процессе[73].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Открытый характер модели редактирования является центральным для большой части критики Википедии.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Например, исходя из этого, можно упрекать Википедию в том, что читатель статьи не может быть уверен без ознакомления со страницей её «истории», была ли эта статья вандализирована.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Критики утверждают, что редактирование статей неэкспертами подрывает качество представленного в статье материала.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Поскольку участники обычно, как правило, переписывают или редактируют отдельные небольшие части статьи, а не всю её целиком, высоко- и низкокачественные материалы могут идти вперемешку в пределах одной статьи.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Историк Рой Розенцвейг отметил: «В целом, написание является „ахиллесовой пятой“ Википедии.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Комитеты редко пишут хорошо, и статьи Википедии часто имеют изменчивое качество, что является результатом связывания вместе предложений или абзацев, написанных разными людьми»[74].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Всё это привело к вопросу о надёжности Википедии в качестве источника достоверной информации.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Модель Википедии позволяет редактировать её статьи всем желающим и полагается на большую группу благонамеренных редакторов в преодолении проблем, вызванных сомнительными редакторами.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Она основана и на принципе, согласно которому подавляющее большинство участников Википедии предполагает добрые намерения.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Модели редактирования Википедии свойственна возможность добавления низкокачественной информации.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Возможность анонимного редактирования может быть не только большим благом для проекта, но и источником некоторого вреда.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Википедия может подвергаться воздействию вандалов.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Вандализм в Википедии — явно вредительское добавление, удаление или изменение содержания, совершённое умышленно в целях скомпрометировать достоверность и авторитетность энциклопедии.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"В основном вандализм проявляется в замене содержимого статей Википедии на ругательства, граффити, заведомо ложные данные или другое содержимое, абсолютно не имеющее отношения к теме статьи.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
В случаях множественного вандализма к некоторым страницам Википедии может быть применена защита.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Являясь общедоступным интернет-справочником, Википедия также содержит материалы, которые другие участники Википедии могут признать нежелательными, оскорбительными или порнографическими[75][76].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Например, в 2008 году Википедия отклонила массовое онлайн-обращение против включения изображения Мухаммеда в её английский раздел, сославшись на свою редакционную политику.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Наличие в Википедии материалов, «неудобных» с политической точки зрения, также побудило КНР заблокировать доступ к части Википедии для китайских пользователей[77] (см.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
также Блокирование Википедии британской организацией Internet Watch Foundation).,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Один из основателей Википедии Ларри Сэнгер, который является и одним из её самых жёстких критиков, в 2015 году заявил, что для него Википедия стала разочарованием, поскольку она была захвачена троллями и участниками, чей антиэлитаризм поставил крест на достоверности статей.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"По словам Сэнгера, Википедия напоминает «психбольницу, управление которой осуществляют сумасшедшие»[31].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
В 2017 году директор некоммерческого партнёрства «Викимедиа.ру» Владимир Медейко объявил о готовности русскоязычной версии «Википедии» к сотрудничеству с обществом «Знание» в деле верификации статей.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"По его словам, возможны два варианта подобного взаимодействия: использование экспертами «Знания» функции «сообщить об ошибке» с последующим написанием там своих комментариев, которые будут проверены участниками «Википедии», либо создание специального проекта по взаимодействию «Википедии» и «Знания»[78].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Техническое функционирование Википедии обеспечивает «Фонд Викимедиа» — некоммерческая организация, которая также поддерживает работу ряда других вики-проектов и осуществляет их финансирование.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Фонд также владеет торговой маркой «Wikipedia», но в содержание энциклопедии и в деятельность добровольцев практически никак не вмешивается.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Фонд, поддерживаемые им проекты и глобальное сообщество добровольных редакторов образуют Движение Викимедиа.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
В разных странах созданы региональные организации (т. н.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"«Отделения Викимедиа») и местные ассоциации википедистов, которые также участвуют в продвижении, развитии и финансировании проекта.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Функционирование Википедии зависит от MediaWiki — программного механизма для веб-сайтов, работающих по технологии «вики».",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"MediaWiki написан на PHP и для хранения данных использует реляционную базу данных (можно использовать MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite) и поддерживает использование программ memcached и Squid[79].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"MediaWiki предоставляет интерфейс для работы с базой страниц, разграничение прав доступа к администрированию системы, возможность обработки текста как в собственном формате, так и в форматах HTML и TeX (для формул), возможность загрузки изображений и других файлов, а также другие возможности.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Гибкая система расширений позволяет пользователям добавлять собственные новые возможности и программные интерфейсы.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"MediaWiki лицензирован под GNU General Public License и используется всеми проектами Викимедиа, а также многими другими вики-проектами.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Первоначально Википедия работала на UseModWiki, написанном на Perl Клиффордом Адамсом («Фаза I»), который первоначально требовал CamelCase для указания ссылок на статьи; используемый сейчас стиль двойных скобок был включён позже.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
С января 2002 года («Фаза II») Википедия начала работать на PHP-викидвижке с базой данных MySQL; это ПО было сделано на заказ для Википедии Магнусом Манске.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ПО «Фазы II» было неоднократно модифицировано с учётом экспоненциально растущего спроса.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"В июле 2002 года («Фаза III») Википедия перешла на третье поколение программного обеспечения, движок MediaWiki, первоначально написанный Даниэлем Ли Крокером.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Википедия в настоящее время работает на выделенных кластерах серверов Linux (в основном Ubuntu[80][81]), с несколькими машинами OpenSolaris для ZFS.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Вики-проекты Фонда Викимедиа, самым крупным из которых является Википедия, по состоянию на март 2013 года поддерживались работой нескольких кластеров, состоящих из 974 серверов[82].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Википедия работала на одном сервере до 2004 года, когда настройка сервера была расширена в распределённую многоуровневую архитектуру.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"В январе 2005 года проект работал на 39 выделенных серверах, расположенных в штате Флорида.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Эта конфигурация включала в себя один главный сервер баз данных с запущенным MySQL, несколько подчинённых серверов баз данных, 21 веб-сервер с запущенным Apache HTTP Server и 7 серверов кэша Squid.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Википедия получает от 25 000 до 60 000 запросов страниц в секунду, в зависимости от времени суток[83].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Запрос страницы сначала передаётся внешнему уровню кэширующих серверов Squid[84].,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Запросы, которые не могут быть обслужены кэшем Squid, направляются на балансирующие нагрузку сервера с запущенным ПО Linux Virtual Server, который, в свою очередь, передаёт запрос на один из веб-серверов Apache для рендеринга (перевода в HTML) страниц из базы данных.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Веб-сервера доставляют страницы по запросу, выполняя рендеринг страницы для всех языковых разделов Википедии.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Для увеличения скорости в дальнейшем, переведённые в HTML страницы некоторое время хранятся в распределённом кэше в памяти.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Это позволяет пропустить процесс рендеринга страницы для наиболее часто запрашиваемых статей.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Обзор архитектуры системы на декабрь 2010 года (серьёзно устарел) Сетевая топология с 2015 года.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"В Амстердаме — esams (Caching) и knams (Networking) Большая часть текстового содержания Википедии доступна в соответствии с лицензиями Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike (CC-BY-SA) и GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL) — копилефт-лицензиями, разрешающими дальнейшее распространение, создание производных работ, а также коммерческое использование содержания, в то время как авторы сохраняют своё авторское право на свои работы.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Часть текстов доступна только под лицензией CC-BY-SA, о чём должна иметься пометка в самой статье, на её странице обсуждения или в истории правок[86].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Положение о том, что Википедия — это просто услуга размещения этих текстов, было успешно использовано в качестве защиты в суде[87][88].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Изначально использовалась только лицензия GFDL, однако позднее был осуществлён переход на лицензию CC-BY-SA, так как GFDL, первоначально предназначенная для руководств к программному обеспечению, сложно использовать для онлайн-справочников[89].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3 ноября 2008 года в ответ на просьбу Фонда Викимедиа Free Software Foundation (FSF) выпустила новую версию FDL, разработанную специально для того, чтобы позволить Википедии перелицензировать её материалы под CC-BY-SA до 1 августа 2009 года.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Википедия и её братские проекты провели широкий референдум в сообществе относительно того, стоит ли перейти на другую лицензию[90][91].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
В результате переход был осуществлён.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Обработка мультимедийных файлов (например файлов изображений) различна в разных языковых версиях.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Некоторые языковые разделы (например английская Википедия) включают несвободные файлы в соответствии с доктриной добросовестного использования, в то время как другие предпочли не делать этого.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Это происходит отчасти из-за разницы в законах об авторском праве в разных странах, например, понятие добросовестного использования не существует в японском авторском праве.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Медиафайлы, доступные в соответствии с лицензиями свободного содержания (например CC-BY-SA от Creative Commons), распределяются между языковыми версиями Викисклада (англ.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Wikimedia Commons) — общего централизованного хранилища мультимедийных файлов, включаемых в страницы проектов Фонда Викимедиа.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Несколько языковых версий опубликовали подборку статей Википедии в версии на оптических дисках.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Английская версия, 2006 Wikipedia CD Selection, содержала около 2000 статей.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ещё одна английская версия[92], разработанная Linterweb, содержит «1988+ статей»[93][94].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Польская версия содержит около 240 000 статей[95].,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Существует также несколько немецких версий[96].,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Первое издание немецкой Википедии было выпущено на CD в декабре 2004 года и стоило 3 €[97].,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Было разослано около 40 000 дисков.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Второе издание вышло в апреле 2005 года как на CD, так и на DVD.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Диск содержал 205 000 статей и 10 000 изображений, находящихся в общественном достоянии.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Directmedia продала 30 000 дисков по 9,90 € каждый.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
В декабре того же года появилось третье издание.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"В него вошли DVD (300 000 статей и 100 000 изображений) и книга объёмом 139 страниц, в которой рассказывалось, что такое Википедия, а также излагались её история и основные правила.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Диск и книга были изданы компанией Zenodot Verlagsgesellschaft mbH и продавались по той же цене, что и предыдущее издание.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Диск можно было бесплатно скачать в Интернете.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"В январе 2006 года Zenodot анонсировала выпуск печатного издания Википедии в 100 томах, по 800 страниц каждый.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Последний том планировалось выпустить в 2010 году.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Позже было объявлено, что проект заморожен[98].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
В декабре 2006 года был создан обновлённый образ диска.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"DVD не издавался, но доступен для скачивания с сайта dvd.wikimedia.org.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"DVD-диск с английской Википедией, содержащий 1964 статьи по основным темам, был выпущен в сотрудничестве с компанией Linterweb в январе 2007 года и обозначен как версия 0.5.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"В качестве оболочки использовалась среда Kiwix, программное обеспечение с открытым исходным кодом, специально написанное для данного издания.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
В данный момент ведётся подготовка версий 0.7 и 1.0.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Последним на данный момент[когда?],Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
был издан DVD польского раздела.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Его выпустило издательство Helion в конце июля 2007 года.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Работа над изданием велась более года, на основе дампа от 4 июня 2006 года.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"База статей, имевшихся на тот момент, была скопирована на отдельный сервер, и их дорабатывали 13 оплачиваемых редакторов и около 20 добровольцев.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
В итоге на диск вошло около 239 000 статей и 59 000 изображений.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Стоимость диска на момент выпуска составляла 39 злотых[99][100].,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
В 2009 году художник Роб Мэттьюс (англ.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rob Matthews) распечатал избранные статьи английского раздела Википедии на 5000 страниц и сшил их в книгу с твёрдым переплётом.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Как он написал в пояснении к этому проекту: Воспроизведение Википедии в ущербной физической форме помогает легче ставить под сомнение разумность её использования.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
В 2010 году английский писатель Джеймс Брайдл (англ.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"James Bridle) выпустил в единственном экземпляре двенадцатитомное издание объёмом 7000 страниц, озаглавленное «Иракская война: Историография изменений в Википедии», в котором отображена каждая правка в англоязычной статье про Иракскую войну с декабря 2004 года по ноябрь 2009 года[102].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"В дополнение к логистическому росту количества статей[103], Википедия неуклонно приобретала статус общего справочного сайта с момента её создания в 2001 году[104].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"На май 2018 года, согласно Alexa, Википедия занимала 5-е место среди самых посещаемых сайтов в мире[11], в Рунете — 9-е место[105].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
В первой десятке Википедия является единственным некоммерческим сайтом.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Рост Википедии был вызван её доминирующей позицией в результатах поиска Google[106].,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Около 50 % трафика с поисковых систем в Википедию пришло с Google[107], большая часть этого трафика связана с научными исследованиями[108].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"В апреле 2007 года проектом Pew Internet & American Life Project было установлено, что треть американских интернет-пользователей консультируются с Википедией[109].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"По оценкам на октябрь 2006 года, сайт имел гипотетическую рыночную стоимость в 580 млн долларов, если бы он запустил рекламу.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Википедия используется в образовательном процессе[110], научных исследованиях, книгах, конференциях, при отправлении правосудия[111][112], а также в работе различных министерств и ведомств.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Так, сайт Парламента Канады ссылался на статью Википедии об однополых браках в разделе «Ссылки по теме» в списке «читать далее».",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Утверждения энциклопедии всё чаще используются в качестве источника такими организациями, как Федеральный суд США и Всемирная организация интеллектуальной собственности[113][неавторитетный источник?]",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"— хотя в основном в качестве поддерживающей информации, а не информации, имеющей решающее значение для дела[114].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Содержание Википедии было цитировано в качестве источника и ссылки в некоторых докладах Разведывательного ведомства США[115].,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"В 2013 году венгерские учёные показали, что с помощью Википедии можно предсказывать популярность и кассовые сборы фильмов, ещё не вышедших в прокат[116][117].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Википедия была также использована в качестве источника в журналистике[118], иногда без указания авторства, а также несколько журналистов были уволены за плагиат из Википедии[119][120][121].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
В июле 2007 года Википедии был посвящён 30-минутный документальный фильм на BBC Radio 4[122].,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Он утверждал, что количество ссылок на Википедию в популярной культуре таково, что этот термин является одним из группы избранных существительных XXI века, которые так узнаваемы (Google, Facebook, YouTube), что они больше не нуждаются в объяснениях и находятся на одном уровне с такими терминами XX века, как Hoovering или Coke.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Существует много пародий на открытость Википедии с персонажами, вандализирующими или изменяющими статьи онлайн-энциклопедии.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Примечательно, что комик Стивен Колберт пародировал Википедию или ссылался на Википедию в многочисленных эпизодах его шоу The Colbert Report и придумал соответствующий термин «wikiality»[123].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Помимо выполнения функции энциклопедического справочника, Википедия стала главным объектом внимания СМИ как сетевой источник последних новостей[124][125].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Когда популярный американский еженедельник Time признал некоего абстрактного представителя миллионов вкладчиков пользовательского контента в различные сайты, носящего обобщённое имя «ты», «Человеком года — 2006», тем самым отмечая ускоряющийся успех онлайн-сотрудничества и взаимодействия миллионов интернет-пользователей по всему миру, Википедия была наиболее часто упоминающимся проектом Веб 2.0, за которым следовали проекты YouTube и MySpace[126].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Википедия также создала формы воздействия на средства массовой информации (СМИ).,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Некоторые СМИ высмеивают восприимчивость Википедии к вставкам неточностей — например, статья на первой странице в The Onion в июле 2006 года под названием «„Википедия“ празднует 750 лет американской независимости»[127].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Другие могут опираться на утверждение Википедии о том, что любой может править, — например «The Negotiation», эпизод сериала «Офис», где персонаж Майкл Скотт заявил: «„Википедия“ — лучшая вещь на свете.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Любой в мире может написать всё, что хочет, по любому предмету; таким образом вы знаете, что получаете лучшую возможную информацию».",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Пародируются также правила Википедии, например, в комиксе xkcd «Wikipedian Protester».",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Первый документальный фильм о Википедии, озаглавленный «Истина в цифрах: Рассказ о Википедии», был выпущен в 2010 году.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28 сентября 2007 года итальянский политик Франко Гриллини инициировал парламентский запрос с министром культурных ресурсов и деятельности о необходимости свободы панорамы.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Он сказал, что отсутствие такой свободы заставило Википедию, «седьмой сайт, с которым больше всего консультируются», запретить все изображения современных итальянских зданий и искусства, и заявил, что этим был нанесён очень серьёзный ущерб туристической отрасли.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"16 сентября 2007 года The Washington Post сообщила о том, что Википедия стала координационным центром избирательной кампании в США в 2008 году, заявив: «Введите имя кандидата в Google, и среди первых результатов будет страница Википедии, что делает эти статьи, возможно, такими же важными, как любое объявление в определении кандидата.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"В настоящее время уже президентские статьи редактируются, расчленяются и обсуждаются бесчисленное множество раз каждый день»[128].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"В октябре 2007 года статья Reuters, озаглавленная «Страница Википедии — последний символ статуса», сообщила о том, как наличие статьи в Википедии подтверждает статус знаменитости[129].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Википедия выиграла две крупные награды в мае 2004 года[130].,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Первой была Золотая Ника цифрового сообщества на ежегодном конкурсе Prix Ars Electronica; она была получена вместе с грантом 10 000 € (6588 £; 12 700 $) и предоставлением приглашения присутствовать на PAE Cyberarts Festival в Австрии позднее в том же году.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Второй была судейская награда Webby в категории «сообщество»[131].,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Википедия была также номинирована на «Лучшую практику» Webby.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"26 января 2007 года Википедия была также признана четвёртым высшим брендом в рейтинге читателей brandchannel.com, получив 15 % голосов в ответ на вопрос: «Какая марка имела наибольшее влияние на нашу жизнь в 2006 году?»[132].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"В сентябре 2008 года Википедия получила награду «Квадрига» A Mission of Enlightenment от Werkstatt Deutschland вместе с Борисом Тадичем, Eckart Höfling и Питером Габриэлем.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Награда была вручена Джимми Уэйлсу Дэвидом Вайнбергером[133].,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Википедия многократно получала российскую государственную Премию Рунета в нескольких номинациях, прежде всего как «научно-образовательный сайт года» в экспертных голосованиях и как лидер массовых онлайн-голосований («народная десятка»).",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Хотя Википедия позиционирует себя как вторичный источник информации[134], 2009 и 2018 годы были отмечены использованием материалов из Википедии как с атрибутированием к источникам[135][136], так и без ссылки[137].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"27 января 2013 года в «Циркуляре малых планет» была сделана запись, согласно которой «Астероид 274301», открытый украинскими астрономами 25 августа 2008 года, был назван «274301 Wikipedia»[138].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Открытие было сделано в «Андрушевской астрономической обсерватории», находящейся в Житомирской области[138].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
22 октября 2014 года в польском городе Слубице был открыт первый в мире памятник Википедии[139].,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Учёными из Массачусетского технологического института (MIT) и Питтсбургского университета было проведено исследование об использовании ссылок на статьи из «Википедии» в научных работах.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"По словам авторов, его результаты свидетельствуют о том, что публикация научных знаний в доступных источниках является экономически эффективным способом продвижения науки, что особенно полезно для тех, кто не имеет доступа к традиционным источникам научной информации[140].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Время от времени некоторые страны закрывают или угрожают закрыть доступ к Википедии.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"В том числе: Исследовательский коллектив из Массачусетского технологического института и университета Питтсбурга установил прямую корреляцию между наличием информации в Википедии и вероятностью того, что учёные будут использовать её при работе над научными статьями и монографиями[143].",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Фонд Викимедиа, компания-владелец и организатор Википедии, поддерживает и другие проекты по созданию свободных публикаций в Интернете: Машинное обучение (англ.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"machine learning, ML) — класс методов искусственного интеллекта, характерной чертой которых является не прямое решение задачи, а обучение в процессе применения решений множества сходных задач.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Для построения таких методов используются средства математической статистики, численных методов, математического анализа, методов оптимизации, теории вероятностей, теории графов, различные техники работы с данными в цифровой форме.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Различают два типа обучения: Дедуктивное обучение принято относить к области экспертных систем, поэтому термины машинное обучение и обучение по прецедентам можно считать синонимами.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Многие методы индуктивного обучения разрабатывались как альтернатива классическим статистическим подходам.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Многие методы тесно связаны с извлечением информации (англ.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"information extraction, information retrieval), интеллектуальным анализом данных (data mining).",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Имеется множество объектов (ситуаций) и множество возможных ответов (откликов, реакций).",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Существует некоторая зависимость между ответами и объектами, но она неизвестна.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Известна только конечная совокупность прецедентов — пар «объект, ответ», называемая обучающей выборкой.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"На основе этих данных требуется восстановить неявную зависимость, то есть построить алгоритм, способный для любого возможного входного объекта выдать достаточно точный классифицирующий ответ.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Эта зависимость не обязательно выражается аналитически, и здесь нейросети реализуют принцип эмпирически формируемого решения.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Важной особенностью при этом является способность обучаемой системы к обобщению, то есть к адекватному отклику на данные, выходящие за пределы имеющейся обучающей выборки.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Для измерения точности ответов вводится оценочный функционал качества.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Данная постановка является обобщением классических задач аппроксимации функций.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
В классических задачах аппроксимации объектами являются действительные числа или векторы.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"В реальных прикладных задачах входные данные об объектах могут быть неполными, неточными, нечисловыми, разнородными.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

золотой хлеб Когда-то в маленькой деревушке жила женщина по имени Марион.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Со своей единственной дочерью Нарциса Марион была чрезвычайно скромной и милой Нарцисой, однако была полной противоположностью, как вы видите, она была прекрасна выше слов, она была как живая.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"кукла, и что самое забавное, она любила себя бесконечно, Нарцисса, не так ли?",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Помоги мне испечь хлеб, да не мама, горничные, все мои яркие и блестящие глаза.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Нарцисса, не могли бы вы помочь мне посадить эти семена, зачем мне это делать?",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"У меня вся эта грязь на моих прекрасных пальчиках, хуже того, что, если она хорошо попадет на мое лицо, это была проблема с Нарцисой.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"она считала себя слишком великой, чтобы выполнять какую-либо работу, многие женихи приходили просить нарцисса руки и сердца.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"поскольку ее красота была известна повсюду, но она отвергла их всех очень грубо, почему ты вчера прогнала этих мужчин, они казались милыми, ты не можешь быть серьезной мамой, одна из них.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"у него были такие маленькие глаза, почти как у птицы, а у другого был огромный нос, я бы не хотел быть рядом с ним.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"когда он чихнул, о, о, и последняя остановка, нет, я не хочу больше слышать, все, что я мог видеть, это то, что эти люди были действительно хорошими, моя дорогая, ты должна знать эту красоту.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Не все, мама, ты должна понять, что я заслуживаю кого-то вроде принца или рыцаря.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"о, дорогая, однажды ночью, когда она спала, ее мать сидела рядом с ней и смотрела на нее.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"мое дорогое дитя, ты такая красивая и милая, но тебя не волнует ничего, кроме своей красоты.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"в этот момент Нарцисс начал смеяться во сне, ее мать была чрезвычайно удивлена, как хорошо ей, должно быть, снится действительно забавный сон на следующее утро, когда Нарцисс.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Я проснулся, она вся улыбалась и хихикала, дорогая, расскажи мне, что тебе снилось.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"прошлой ночью, мама, это был такой потрясающий сон, ты знаешь, что ко мне подошел принц.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"и сказал, что хочет жениться на мне, он приехал в золотой карете, и он был одет сверху донизу и тоже золотом, что за глупый сон.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"и ты знаешь, лучшая часть этого была, когда я была в моем свадебном платье, которое тоже было золотым, конечно, все смотрели только на меня, Нарцисса, нет ничего удивительного в этом сне.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Это был очень эгоистичный сон, мама, ты не понимаешь, о чем говоришь, этот сон заставил меня осознать, что мне нужна еда гораздо более грандиозная, чем та, которую я ем здесь, дома, хлеб из золота.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"только подумайте о той бедной матери-нарциссе, которая так волновалась за свою дочь и как.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"она проживет свою жизнь в тот день, когда двое друзей пришли навестить мать Нарцисса, они были Мелли и Терри, они трое были друзьями много лет, но у Терри и Элли был секрет их обоих.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"были волшебными существами, о которых мать Нарцисса ничего не знала о Терри Мелли, о, как приятно тебя видеть, это было очень давно как дела?",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"я был очень хорош, я был бы лучше, если бы только что, если бы моя дочь Нарциса была немного более понимающей Мариан рассказала Мелли и Терри все о Нарцисе и о том, как она переживает за нее, она хочет есть хлеб из золота что мне с ней делать ну может, если ее мечта сбудется.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"это было бы замечательно, не так ли?",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Неважно, я думаю, со временем она вырастет, чтобы научиться, давай поговорим о другом.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"теперь, позже Мелли и Терри помахали на прощание своему старому другу и ушли, тайно улыбаясь друг другу в ту ночь, мать и дочь.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"приготовилась ко сну, мама, я действительно надеюсь, что моя мечта сбудется, ты знаешь, о Нарцисса, на следующий день, когда Нарциса и ее мать были в саду в красивом месте.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"К ним подъехала золотая карета, она была усыпана драгоценными камнями и бриллиантами и выглядела чрезвычайно потрясающе.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"когда она остановилась, красивый мужчина вышел из нее и посмотрел на Нарцису, она была полностью поражена тем, насколько он красив, моя мечта на самом деле сбывается ммм.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Привет, я пришел попросить нарцисса руки и сердца, но откуда ты знаешь ее имя и кто ты?",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Я Терренс, ангел удачи.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Имя твоей дочери и красота известны во всем мире.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Я принес тебе подарок.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Но ты почти не знаешь его, ты не можешь пойти с ним.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"о, глупый, он богат и красив, чего еще мне еще нужно, Терренс, я принимаю ваше предложение.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"И с этими словами она села в его карету, и, даже не попрощавшись с матерью, уехала с ангелом, пока они ехали, карета внезапно вошла в волшебный портал, где она путешествовала по бурной местности, карета сильно ударилась и нарцисса.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"был очень напуган, не волнуйся, моя дорогая, все это скоро закончится, как только он сказал это, карета прошла через другой портал и достигла подъездной дорожки.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"огромного и великолепного золотого замка Нарциса была поражена всей красотой, которую она увидела, я знал, что заслуживаю столько богатств, я знал, что вам это понравится, все, что вы хотите, вы найдете здесь, от самых красивых платьев до самых вкусных блюд все это в моем дворце, хорошо говоря о еде, я действительно голоден после этой поездки.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"я голодаю, могу ли я съесть что-нибудь из этой вкусной еды, конечно, здесь мясо вонючая мелисса, она принесет тебе все, что ты хочешь, я так много слышал о тебе ты, бедный, дорогой, ты голоден Я принесу тебе немного еды, о, спасибо, они пошли в столовую, и там на столе была самая поразительная еда, которую Нарциса когда-либо видела удивительной, потому что это варенье.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"из рубинов салаты из изумрудов и хлеб там сделан из золотого золотого хлеба, как прекрасно это варенье будет выглядеть и вкусно с хлебом, который она взяла с собой.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"рубиновое варенье на нем и откусил огромный кусок, это так жарко, я не могу так хорошо есть, это хлеб из золота, и он тоже самый лучший, но если ты не можешь его съесть, должен я тебе достать серебряный хлеб ты ешь.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"что-то еще, но я хочу нормальный хлеб, который я могу съесть, разве ты не выглядишь так будущая жена моего отца, ракушка, холодно, ты должен есть только лучший нарцис.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Я смотрел на всю еду.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"но была убита горем из-за всего, что было несъедобным, она вскоре начала плакать, я не хочу этого, но еда действительно хорошая.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"вот попробуйте золотого картофеля, он действительно хорош, и после того, как вы выйдете за меня замуж.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"тебе придется все это съесть, я думал, тебе нравятся модные вещи, нет, я не хочу жениться на тебе, я хочу домой.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
чтобы моя мать отпустила меня домой Мелисса и Терренс посмотрели друг на друга и хорошо подмигнули.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Если это действительно то, чего ты хочешь, я отведу тебя домой, Терренс принял плачущий и несчастный.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Нарцис дома в карете она начала глубоко думать о выборе, который она сделала, когда вернулась домой.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"она побежала обнять свою мать, которая сидела в доме грустная, ни сестра, о моя милая дочь, я думал, что никогда больше тебя не увижу.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"о, мама, я так тебя люблю, и ты была правильной внешностью, и богатство - это еще не все, золотой хлеб был бесполезен, потому что я не мог есть его и этого человека, хотя.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"он был красив, он вообще не заботился обо мне, но моя дорогая, ты понимаешь, что именно так ты относился к другим, я знаю, мне очень жаль, как я вела себя, мама, о нет, все в порядке, раз ты видела.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"в чем была твоя ошибка, давай с того дня накормим тебя чем-нибудь приятным.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Нарциса изменила свой образ жизни, сначала она боролась, но постепенно и терпеливо она начала становиться намного лучше.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Однажды Мелли и Терри снова пришли встретиться с Мариан.,Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"О, привет, вы двое, так скажите нам Мэриан.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Как' теперь нарциссизм Мэриан рассказал им обоим все, что произошло, и она так сильно изменилась с того времени.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Думаю, она не хотела бы больше золотого хлеба, а ты знаешь.",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Терри вы на самом деле немного похожи на этого ангела, хотя что я вижу, как вы могли быть им, вы двое такие милые",Russian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Nature è una delle più antiche ed importanti riviste scientifiche esistenti, forse in assoluto quella considerata di maggior prestigio nell'ambito della comunità scientifica internazionale (insieme a Science).",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[1] Viene pubblicata fin dal 4 novembre 1869.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[2] Nonostante la maggior parte delle riviste del campo siano oggi altamente specializzate, Nature è uno dei pochi giornali, insieme ad altri mensili quali Science e Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, che pubblica ancora articoli originali su svariati campi scientifici.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Molti sono gli avanzamenti e le scoperte, provenienti da molti campi della ricerca scientifica, che sono stati pubblicati su Nature, come articoli o lettere: ad esempio, la scoperta dei raggi X, la natura ondulatoria delle particelle, la scoperta dei neutroni, le scoperte sulla fissione nucleare, la struttura a doppia elica del DNA, la prima struttura molecolare di una proteina (la mioglobina), la tettonica a zolle, il buco dell'ozono, la prima clonazione di un mammifero (la pecora Dolly), il sequenziamento del genoma umano.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Il fattore di impatto (impact factor) di questa rivista supera nel 2014 l'enorme valore di 42,352.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[3] Oltre a Nature stesso, ci sono tre famiglie di riviste scientifiche legate a Nature, edite dal Nature Publishing Group: In un'intervista pubblicata nel 2013 su The Guardian, Randy Schekman rilascia delle dichiarazioni riguardanti le grandi riviste scientifiche (facendo il nome di Nature, Science o Cell), additandole come colpevoli di danneggiare l'attività di ricerca scientifica.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Secondo Randy Schekman l'incentivo più forte nella ricerca scientifica è quello di vedere pubblicate le proprie ricerche nelle prestigiose riviste scientifiche, poiché a questo viene fatto coincidere il più alto riconoscimento del proprio lavoro; tale ragionamento è razionale, ma non porta sempre a servire gli interessi della propria professione, né quelli dell'umanità o della società.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Questo perché le grandi riviste scientifiche tendono a «curare in modo aggressivo i loro brand mettendo al primo posto la vendita di abbonamenti, più che la pubblicazione di tutte le ricerche più significative [...] mentre pubblicano molte ricerche rilevanti, tendono tuttavia a non pubblicare tutte le ricerche rilevanti, né sono gli unici a pubblicarle».",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Nell'articolo Randy Schekman critica sia la selezione assai restrittiva delle ricerche pubblicate da parte delle riviste scientifiche famose, sia l'impact factor, considerandolo come un trucco di marketing dietro il quale le grandi riviste acquistano notorietà; infatti l'impact factor misura solamente il numero delle volte che una determinata rivista scientifica risulta citata nelle ricerche scientifiche successive, senza considerare la qualità o l'importanza della ricerca stessa «una rivista scientifica può venire citata perché pubblica ricerche significative, o anche perché pubblica qualcosa di accattivante, provocativo o addirittura sbagliato».",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Questo influenza l'attività di ricerca, in quanto la indirizza in quella direzione dove è possibile tirare fuori le conclusioni che vogliono queste riviste, scoraggiando invece una direzione che potrebbe essere più importante, ma magari meno accattivante ai lettori.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[4] Altri progetti Wikipedia (pronuncia: vedi sotto) è un'enciclopedia online a contenuto libero, collaborativa, multilingue e gratuita, nata nel 2001, sostenuta e ospitata dalla Wikimedia Foundation, un'organizzazione non a scopo di lucro statunitense.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Lanciata da Jimmy Wales e Larry Sanger il 15 gennaio 2001, inizialmente nell'edizione in lingua inglese, nei mesi successivi ha aggiunto edizioni in numerose altre lingue.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sanger ne suggerì il nome,[1] una parola macedonia nata dall'unione della radice wiki al suffisso pedia (da enciclopedia).",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Etimologicamente, Wikipedia significa ""cultura veloce"", dal termine hawaiano wiki (veloce), con l'aggiunta del suffisso -pedia (dal greco antico παιδεία, paideia, formazione).",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Con più di 55 milioni di voci in oltre 300 lingue,[2] è l'enciclopedia più grande mai scritta,[3][4] è tra i dieci siti web più visitati al mondo[5] e costituisce la maggiore e più consultata opera di riferimento generalista su Internet.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[6][7][8] Wikipedia prese il via come progetto complementare di Nupedia, un progetto per la creazione di un'enciclopedia libera online le cui voci erano scritte da esperti volontari attraverso un processo formale di revisione.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Nupedia venne fondata il 9 marzo 2000 dalla società Bomis, proprietaria dell'omonimo portale di ricerca.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Le figure principali erano Jimmy Wales, allora CEO della Bomis, e Larry Sanger, redattore capo di Nupedia e successivamente di Wikipedia.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[9] Per il concetto di wiki, Wales e Sanger dichiararono di essersi ispirati ai siti WikiWikiWeb o Portland Pattern Repository di Ward Cunningham.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Wikipedia, che esisteva già come servizio di Nupedia.com dal 10 gennaio 2001, fu formalmente lanciata il 15 gennaio successivo sul sito Wikipedia.com, in lingua inglese.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Verso maggio giunsero i primi utenti registrati e, nel corso dell'anno, si svilupparono le edizioni in francese, tedesco, inglese, catalano, spagnolo, svedese, portoghese e, a fine anno, italiano.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Alla fine del suo primo anno di esistenza, l'enciclopedia arrivò a contare quasi 20 000 voci, su 18 edizioni in lingue differenti.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Raggiunse 26 edizioni in lingua alla fine del 2002, 46 alla fine del 2003 e 161 alla fine del 2004.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Nupedia e Wikipedia coesistettero finché i server della prima furono chiusi definitivamente nel 2003 e i suoi testi incorporati in Wikipedia (Nupedia aveva sofferto un tasso di crescita estremamente lento, a causa dei complicati processi di revisione, riuscendo a pubblicare solo 24 voci); Sanger uscì di scena e un gruppo di utenti attuò una biforcazione della Wikipedia in spagnolo per costituire l'Enciclopedia Libre.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Da Wikipedia e Nupedia, nacque nel 2003 la Wikimedia Foundation, l'organizzazione non profit che sostiene Wikipedia e i progetti fratelli (il primo dei quali fu In Memoriam: September 11 Wiki) che nel tempo si sono aggiunti, ognuno dei quali è specializzato in un determinato ambito del sapere.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"La Wikimedia Foundation ha infatti successivamente dato vita a progetti complementari tra i quali: Wiktionary, Wikibooks, Wikisource, Wikispecies, Wikiquote, Wikinotizie, Wikiversità e Wikivoyage.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Wales cedette tutti i diritti alla fondazione da lui promossa, che tuttora gestisce i marchi e l'infrastruttura informatica, garantendo che la gestione dei contenuti rimanesse affidata alla comunità degli utenti.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Se nei primi due anni cresceva alla velocità di poche centinaia o meno di nuove voci al giorno, l'edizione in inglese di Wikipedia raggiunse il traguardo delle 100 000 voci nel gennaio 2003, mentre nel 2004 subì un'esplosione, raddoppiando le dimensioni in un anno (con un aumento da 1 000 a 3 000 voci al giorno).",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Wikipedia ha raggiunto la sua milionesima voce, tra le 105 edizioni in lingua all'epoca presenti, il 20 settembre 2004.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A partire dal 2004 è iniziata a costituirsi una rete di associazioni nazionali collegate alla Wikimedia Foundation (chiamati ""capitoli ufficiali""), tra le quali Wikimedia Italia, fondata nel 2005.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nel settembre dello stesso anno l'edizione in italiano ha superato le 100 000 voci.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Da quando Wikipedia ha raggiunto un considerevole numero di voci e di utilizzatori, è diventata un tipico fenomeno del Web 2.0, grazie anche alla sua particolarità di essere rapidamente modificabile e aggiornabile da chiunque.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Nel settembre 2007, l'edizione in inglese ha tagliato lo storico traguardo di 2 milioni di voci, divenendo la più vasta enciclopedia mai scritta, superando l'enciclopedia Yongle (1407), che ha detenuto tale primato per 600 anni esatti;[3] nel Guinness dei primati del 2008 Wikipedia è riportata come la più grande enciclopedia al mondo.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[4] Il 27 marzo 2008, con oltre 250 edizioni locali, ha raggiunto i 10 milioni di voci,[10] che erano raddoppiate il 18 novembre 2011[11] e triplicate nel giro dei tre anni successivi, superando nel 2015 i 35 milioni di voci.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A settembre 2015 le edizioni di Wikipedia con più di 100 000 voci erano divenute 53, scritte in altrettante lingue, di cui 12 superavano il milione.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[2] L'obiettivo di Wikipedia è creare un'enciclopedia libera, ovvero liberamente accessibile, a contenuto libero, aperto, e ""universale"" in termini di ampiezza di argomenti trattati.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Wikipedia è stata descritta da Jimmy Wales, uno dei suoi fondatori, come «uno sforzo per creare e distribuire un'enciclopedia libera della più alta qualità possibile a ogni singola persona sul pianeta nella sua propria lingua.» Wikipedia, nelle intenzioni di Wales, doveva raggiungere nel lungo termine una qualità pari o migliore dell'Enciclopedia Britannica ed essere pubblicata anche su carta.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Il progetto, ambizioso, ma realistico, si colloca dunque nell'ambito della condivisione della conoscenza e della cultura partecipativa sfruttando la cosiddetta intelligenza collettiva sulla base delle regole d'uso e di contribuzione espresse dall'enciclopedia stessa.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In quanto enciclopedia a carattere universale (o ""generalista""), Wikipedia tratta voci di molti argomenti diversi.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Le voci sono organizzate in categorie tematiche; i temi generali sono generalmente illustrati da portali e coordinati tramite progetti.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"L'enciclopedia è completamente gratuita e priva di pubblicità, in linea con i suoi principi base: il suo sostentamento è dovuto unicamente alle libere donazioni degli utenti, grazie a una raccolta fondi[12] avviata ogni anno dalla Wikimedia Foundation.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Il logo ufficiale di Wikipedia è una sfera quasi completa costruita con pezzi di puzzle che riportano caratteri di vari alfabeti, a simboleggiare il mondo e una conoscenza globale in costruzione, a disposizione di tutti.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Su Internet esistono o sono esistiti molti altri progetti enciclopedici.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In generale dispongono di una linea editoriale stabilita e fanno uso delle tradizionali politiche sulla proprietà intellettuale dei contenuti, come per esempio l'Enciclopedia Stanford di Filosofia, compilata da esperti.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Siti web più informali, come H2g2 o Everything2, servono come guide generali le cui voci sono scritte e controllate da persone comuni.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Progetti come Wikipedia, Susning.nu e la Enciclopedia Libre sono invece wiki le cui voci sono sviluppate da numerosi autori e in cui non esiste alcun processo formale di revisione.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wikipedia è il primo e più grande di questi wiki enciclopedici per numero di voci.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A differenza delle enciclopedie che l'hanno preceduta, il contenuto di Wikipedia è distribuito con una licenza libera.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Wikipedia è pubblicata in 309 lingue differenti (di cui circa 299 attive[2]) e contiene voci sia sugli argomenti propri di una tradizionale enciclopedia sia su quelli di almanacchi, dizionari geografici e specialistici.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Il suo scopo è quello di raccogliere dati, informazioni e descrizioni, creando e distribuendo al pubblico un'enciclopedia libera, gratuita e sempre più ricca di contenuti.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Le varie edizioni in lingua sono sviluppate indipendentemente l'una dall'altra, ovvero non sono vincolate ai contenuti presenti nelle altre, ma sono tenute unicamente al rispetto delle linee guida generali del progetto come il punto di vista neutrale.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I testi delle voci e i contenuti multimediali tuttavia sono spesso condivisi tra le varie edizioni: i primi grazie alle traduzioni, i secondi attraverso il progetto condiviso chiamato Wikimedia Commons.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Le voci tradotte rappresentano una percentuale relativamente piccola di quelle presenti in ciascuna edizione.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Le edizioni in lingua tedesca, quella in lingua italiana e una selezione di voci tratte dalla versione in lingua inglese sono state distribuite anche su compact disc e DVD, mentre di molte edizioni sono stati creati dei mirror online o dei progetti derivati.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ad agosto 2015 Wikipedia conteneva in totale più di 35 milioni di voci - in totale oltre 135 milioni di pagine, modificate oltre 2 miliardi di volte - e contava oltre 55 milioni di utenti registrati.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[2] Wikipedia è uno dei dieci siti più visitati al mondo, oscillando nel 2015 tra il sesto e il settimo posto nella classifica mondiale:[13] riceve infatti oltre 374 milioni di visitatori unici al mese (a settembre 2015).",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[che sito si intende?,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"wikipedia.org, en.wikipedia.org o tutte le edizioni linguistiche assieme?",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
][14] Le voci di Wikipedia sono spesso citate dai mass media tradizionali e da istituti accademici.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"«""L'enciclopedia partecipata"" mi preoccupa meno: la uso regolarmente, e trovo che la qualità e l'affidabilità delle informazioni sia notevole.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Qualche problema c'è solo quando il soggetto è estremamente controverso.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In questo caso la neutralità e le reciproche obiezioni spingono verso il minimo comun denominatore, e bisogna accontentarsi.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ma questo è inevitabile, e in fondo accadeva già con le enciclopedie tradizionali.» La caratteristica primaria di Wikipedia è il fatto che dà la possibilità a chiunque di collaborare, utilizzando un sistema di modifica e pubblicazione aperto che si appoggia su una piattaforma Wiki (MediaWiki).",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In altri termini essa è curata da volontari ovvero le pagine possono essere modificate da chiunque e non c'è un comitato di redazione né alcun controllo preventivo sul contenuto inviato.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In particolare essa si basa sul diritto di citazione come testimonianza di attendibilità dei contenuti presenti che citino dunque la fonte di origine, classificandosi dunque come fonte terziaria.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"La registrazione non è obbligatoria, ma consigliata.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A causa della sua natura aperta, vandalismi e imprecisioni sono problemi riscontrabili in Wikipedia.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Il miglioramento dell'enciclopedia è dovuto unicamente al continuo apporto di contributi sia in termini di nuovi contenuti che di revisioni degli stessi, della forma e della formattazione secondo le linee guida da parte di tutti gli utenti volontari[16].",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Caratteristica delle voci di Wikipedia è inoltre l'avere frequenti collegamenti ipertestuali ad altre voci dell'enciclopedia che permettono una facile navigazione nel Portale e un più facile approfondimento di altre voci con uno stile dunque che ricorda il Web 1.0 o Web statico mentre di fatto la piattaforma Mediawiki appartiene al Web 2.0 o Web dinamico.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Tutte le voci sono comunemente rintracciabili tramite ricerca web con Google, che solitamente indicizza tra le prime posizioni, ma l'enciclopedia può essere vista come un vero e proprio portale web il cui accesso è dalla Pagina Principale che fornisce in primo piano una voce del giorno, una voce di qualità, ricorrenze del giorno, un motore di ricerca interno ecc.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Le foto delle varie voci provengono dal progetto Wikimedia Commons sui cui vengono caricate e poi richiamate nelle voci di Wikipedia.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Per garantire tale progresso, Wikipedia si fonda su cinque pilastri, sulle seguenti linee guida, volte ad identificare quali tipi di informazioni siano adatte a esservi inserite e su un codice di comportamento detto Wikiquette.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ad esse si fa spesso riferimento nelle dispute per decidere se un particolare contenuto debba essere aggiunto, rivisto, trasferito ad un progetto affine oppure rimosso.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Uno dei principi alla base di Wikipedia è il ""punto di vista neutrale"",[17] secondo il quale ad esempio le opinioni presentate da personaggi importanti o da opere letterarie vengono riassunte senza tentare di determinarne una verità oggettiva.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Le edizioni di Wikipedia contengono spesso anche uno ''sportello informazioni'' in cui la comunità risponde alle domande tecniche degli utenti.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Wikipedia condivide le risorse software e hardware con gli altri progetti della Wikimedia Foundation, in particolare il motore che interpreta il markup delle pagine (MediaWiki) e i server su cui sono salvati i database che contengono le pagine dell'enciclopedia.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A maggio 2017 sono presenti 296 diverse edizioni linguistiche di Wikipedia (di cui 285 attive).,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"La versione in lingua italiana di Wikipedia è soprannominata it.wiki ed è nata a maggio del 2001, sotto il nome a dominio di terzo livello it.wikipedia.org.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nel 2003 nascono le Wikipedia in latino e in occitano.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ad aprile 2004 nasce la Wikipedia in sardo, poi a ottobre la Wikipedia in siciliano, a gennaio 2005 la Wikipedia in friulano e a seguire, nel corso del 2005, le versioni linguistiche in corso, napoletano, romancio, veneto e lombardo.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Nel 2006 sono nate poi le edizioni in ligure, piemontese, francoprovenzale e tarantino.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nel 2007 è nata quella in emiliano e romagnolo.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"La creazione della Wikipedia in lingua ladina è stata in fase di test fino al 2020, quando è stata resa operativa.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[20] Il nome Wikipedia è composto dal prefisso wiki- (dall'hawaiano wiki, veloce), e dal suffisso -pedia (dal greco antico paideia, formazione).",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Il progetto non prevede una pronuncia ufficiale del suo nome proprio, ma lascia libertà di pronunciarlo secondo le proprie preferenze.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"La pronuncia vichipedìa sarebbe preferibile in quanto linguisticamente più integrata, considerando la pronuncia consolidata in lingua italiana del suffisso -pedìa (-pedìa /peˈdia/, come in enciclopedia)[21] e la pronuncia consolidata della lettera w di wiki (vìchi /ˈviki/, come in wafer o wc).",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[21][22] Anche l'Accademia della Crusca si è espressa analogamente in più occasioni.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[23] Le pronunce anglicizzanti (o inglesi italianizzate), meno integrate nel sistema linguistico dell'italiano, sono tuttavia diffuse.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Il Dizionario di pronuncia italiana di Luciano Canepari, uniformandosi alla pronuncia inglese, riporta /wikiˈpɛdja/ (uichipèdia) come forma primaria, /wikiˈpidja/ (uichipìdia) come accettabile e /wikipeˈdia/ (uichipedìa) come pronuncia intenzionale «per fare sfoggio».",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[24] In inglese si dice comunemente [ˌwɪkiˈpiːdiə] o [ˌwiːkiˈpiːdiə], ma non esiste una pronuncia ufficiale.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Wikipedia non è regolata da alcun comitato di redazione centrale: le sue voci sono scritte spontaneamente da centinaia di migliaia di volontari non remunerati né iscritti ad associazioni, che si organizzano autonomamente stabilendo da soli le regole interne e lo svolgimento degli argomenti nelle voci.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Wikipedia, infatti, è costruita sulla convinzione che la collaborazione tra gli utenti possa nel tempo migliorare le voci, più o meno nello stesso spirito con cui viene sviluppato il software libero.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Nel caso del software, se è libero, chiunque può prelevarne i sorgenti, modificarli e ridistribuirli, eppure solitamente i programmatori si limitano a proporre alcune modifiche agli autori, i quali le adottano oppure no a loro insindacabile giudizio.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Le voci sono sempre aperte alle modifiche (tranne quando vengono protette a tempo determinato a causa di vandalismi o edit war) e non si dichiara mai conclusa la stesura di una voce.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Accade che alcuni utenti provino a inserire informazioni malevole o goliardiche, ma enciclopedicamente irrilevanti, che vengono generalmente rimosse prontamente da altri utenti.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Questo tipo di modifiche è in gergo chiamato vandalismo.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wikipedia mantiene un approccio ottimistico sulla bontà delle modifiche proposte: tutti coloro che visitano il sito di Wikipedia hanno la possibilità di creare o modificare una voce e vedere pubblicate all'istante le loro modifiche.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Gli autori delle voci, che non devono avere necessariamente alcuna competenza o qualifica formale sugli argomenti trattati ma devono basare le proprie pubblicazioni su fonti autorevoli, sono però avvertiti che i loro contributi possono essere cancellati, o a loro volta modificati e redistribuiti da chiunque, nei termini della licenza e delle linee guida interne a Wikipedia.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Le voci sono controllate dalla comunità, con il supporto di un gruppo di amministratori che svolgono alcune azioni tecniche.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Le decisioni da prendere sul contenuto e sulle politiche editoriali di Wikipedia sono ottenute di norma per consenso[25] e in alcuni casi per votazione, sebbene per alcuni anni Jimmy Wales si fosse riservato decisioni in alcuni casi nell'edizione in inglese.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Grazie al software wiki, tutte le modifiche alle voci di Wikipedia sono archiviate in una cronologia delle versioni accessibile a chiunque.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Wikipedia perciò è anche la prima tra le grandi enciclopedie che permette a tutti di osservare il processo di sviluppo nel tempo di una voce e di verificare se, come e dove il contenuto è stato oggetto di controversie.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Persino le cancellazioni e gli altri vandalismi che una pagina subisce sono di norma visibili a tutti.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Tutti i punti di vista contestati, espressi in un dato momento e successivamente cancellati, rimangono consultabili e forniscono informazioni complementari sull'argomento di cui è oggetto la voce e sul suo grado di controversia, aggiungendovi inoltre la dimensione temporale.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Oltre all'editor classico che utilizza un linguaggio di markup estremamente semplificato (ad es.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"molto più semplice dell'HTML) il software MediaWiki mette a disposizione anche un editor visuale, chiamato VisualEditor.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Nel gergo di Wikipedia gli autori - cioè quegli utenti che collaborano attivamente all'inserimento dei contenuti - sono chiamati ""wikipediani"" e formano un'ampia e variegata comunità di pratica.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"L'attività di wikipediano è riconosciuta come ""profilo professionale"" dall'IWA (International Webmasters Association).",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[26] Su Wikipedia non vi sono distinzioni formali tra chi collabora al progetto: le decisioni sono idealmente prese raggiungendo il consenso tra coloro che sono coinvolti.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Nel mese di giugno 2015, gli utenti attivi (cioè quelli che avevano contribuito a Wikipedia con almeno cinque interventi ciascuno) erano 71 000[27] (oltre 40 000 nell'ambito delle tre edizioni maggiori, ovvero quelle in lingua inglese, tedesca e giapponese).",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Il gruppo più attivo, composto da quasi 10 000 utenti (di cui circa il 50% lavorava nelle tre edizioni maggiori), ha fornito 100 contributi o più a testa nel corso del mese.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[28] Secondo Wikimedia un quarto del traffico di Wikipedia proviene da utenti non registrati, che difficilmente diventeranno collaboratori stabili.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I lavori di manutenzione sono svolti da un gruppo di volontari che sono chiamati, a seconda del ruolo, sviluppatori,[29] steward,[30] check user,[31] oversight,[32] burocrati[33] e amministratori;[34] nel complesso alcune migliaia di persone.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Gli amministratori (sysop) sono i più numerosi (oltre quattromila al 2015) e sono loro attribuite alcune funzioni tecniche aggiuntive che servono ad impedire, in caso di necessità, la modifica di singole voci, di cancellare e ripristinare le voci o di togliere (in modo temporaneo o permanente) ad alcuni utenti la facoltà di modificare Wikipedia, seguendo quanto stabilito dalle linee guida della comunità.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Non essendo gli amministratori dei moderatori, il controllo e l'eliminazione dei vandalismi sono a carico di tutta la comunità degli utenti.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Gli atti di vandalismo o le infrazioni più lievi alle linee guida possono comportare un avvertimento o un blocco temporaneo, mentre i blocchi a lungo termine o permanenti in conseguenza di infrazioni prolungate e gravi sono in genere decisi dalla comunità o, in alcune edizioni, da un comitato arbitrale.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[35] L'ex redattore capo di Wikipedia Larry Sanger ha affermato che avere la licenza libera GFDL come ""garanzia di libertà, è una forte motivazione a lavorare in un'enciclopedia libera"".",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In uno studio su Wikipedia come comunità, il docente di economia Andrea Ciffolilli[36] sostenne che il basso costo di transazione nella partecipazione ad un software wiki crea un catalizzatore per lo sviluppo collaborativo e che un approccio alla ""costruzione creativa"" incoraggia la partecipazione.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wikipedia è stata vista come un esperimento sociale di democrazia.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Il suo fondatore ha replicato che non è stata pensata come tale, ma piuttosto ne è una conseguenza.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[37] In una pagina a proposito del fare ricerche con Wikipedia, i suoi autori spiegano che Wikipedia è importante come comunità sociale: agli autori di voci può venir chiesto di difendere o spiegare il loro operato e le discussioni sono immediatamente visibili.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Wikipedia possiede una comunità di utenti che sono in proporzione pochi, ma molto attivi.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"William G. Emigh e Susan C. Herring (2005) affermano che «pochi utenti attivi, quando agiscono in concerto con norme stabilite all'interno di un sistema redazionale aperto, possono raggiungere il controllo totale sul contenuto prodotto nel sistema, cancellando letteralmente diversità, controversie e inconsistenze, e omogeneizzando le voci dei collaboratori.»[38] I redattori di Wikinfo, un progetto derivato da Wikipedia, sostengono analogamente che i contributori nuovi o controversi di Wikipedia sono spesso ingiustamente etichettati troll o utenti problematici e viene loro impedito di apportare modifiche.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
La comunità di Wikipedia è stata anche criticata per il fatto di rispondere alle lamentele riguardo alla qualità di una voce consigliando a chi si lamenta di correggere la voce.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Wikipedia richiede ai propri collaboratori di osservare un punto di vista neutrale[17] quando scrivono e di non inserire alcuna ricerca originale, dal momento che un'enciclopedia è una fonte terziaria.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Questa condotta, se rigorosamente applicata, mette al sicuro l'enciclopedia da eventuali minacce legali per reati di diffamazione e al contempo le conferisce obiettività e affidabilità.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Il punto di vista neutrale, di per sé una linea di condotta non negoziabile, rende chiaro che l'obiettivo dell'enciclopedia è quello di presentare le dispute e descriverle piuttosto che impegnarsi per esse.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Qualora fosse completamente raggiunto, Wikipedia non si troverebbe ad essere scritta sulla base di un singolo punto di vista ""oggettivo"", ma a presentare in modo imparziale tutti gli aspetti di una questione, attribuendoli in modo neutrale ai propri sostenitori.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Questa politica impone che ciascun punto di vista debba ricevere una trattazione adeguata al suo seguito.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Le opinioni e teorie inedite sono considerate ""ricerche originali"" e non sono pubblicabili in Wikipedia, dato che sono incompatibili con il concetto di enciclopedia (che è un'opera compilativa) e non possono essere presentate secondo un punto di vista neutrale e con fonti indipendenti.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I collaboratori di Wikipedia mantengono in più una varietà di politiche e linee guida minori.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Al contrario di altri progetti basati su wiki, come il Portland Pattern Repository di Ward Cunningham (considerato l'inventore del wiki), i wikipediani usano le cosiddette pagine di discussione[39] per discutere le modifiche alle voci, piuttosto che farlo all'interno delle voci stesse.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I collaboratori di Wikipedia spesso modificano, spostano e cancellano le voci che sono considerate inadatte a un'enciclopedia, come le definizioni da dizionario (per cui esistono progetti appositi come il Wikizionario) o testi da fonti originali.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Le varie edizioni di Wikipedia, facenti capo a comunità distinte su base linguistica, stabiliscono autonomamente le proprie convenzioni stilistiche.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Il contenuto di Wikipedia viene distribuito in diverse modalità.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A parte la distribuzione nella sua forma originale online, attraverso i siti ufficiali o i molti mirror creati su altri server web, anche le versioni stampate o pronte alla stampa di Wikipedia hanno ottenuto popolarità.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I cosiddetti WikiReader (pubblicazioni su carta con selezioni di voci) sono stati lanciati dalla Wikipedia tedesca nel tardo febbraio 2004 con il primo WikiReader sulla Svezia di Thomas Karcher.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hanno fatto seguito altri WikiReader preparati nel formato PDF o con le versioni stampate in preparazione per la vendita.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"L'esempio tedesco è stato ripreso altrove per cui sono nati altri progetti WikiReader ad opera degli utenti cinesi, inglesi, francesi e polacchi.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wikipress[40] ha messo in vendita un libro in brossura dell'edizione 2005-2006 comprensivo di un DVD.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In seguito, nel 2009, è stata aggiunta a Wikipedia un'estensione con la quale ogni utente può raccogliere più voci dell'enciclopedia in ""libri"" che possono essere consultati offline e distribuiti come e-book gratuiti o anche essere stampati in volume grazie ad un servizio online a pagamento.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sono disponibili anche CD e DVD di Wikipedia.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Il progetto tedesco di Wikipedia è stato il primo a distribuire una versione su questi supporti nel 2004; attualmente è giunto alla seconda edizione.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A partire dal settembre 2007 anche l'edizione in italiano di Wikipedia è stata pubblicata in una versione in DVD, diventando così la seconda ad essere distribuita su tale supporto.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[41] I contenuti di Wikipedia sono consultabili anche tramite dispositivi mobili (cellulari, palmari, smartphone, ecc.).",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Esiste infatti una versione mobile del sito, che consente di accedere alle voci di Wikipedia presentandole in una veste grafica semplificata, adatta per questo tipo di dispositivi.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Il servizio QRpedia consente di generare codici QR contenenti particolari link che permettono di accedere alla versione di Wikipedia mobile di una data voce, puntando automaticamente alla pagina nella stessa lingua del dispositivo in uso.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sono disponibili inoltre applicazioni dedicate per i vari dispositivi mobili, ad esempio Wikipedia Mobile per iPhone e Wikipedia Mobile per Android.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"«L'atteggiamento dell'accademico medio verso il principale strumento di consultazione della nostra epoca, e in particolare dei nostri studenti, conferma conclusioni cui eravamo già arrivati.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Egli quasi sempre consulta Wikipedia (non per propria scelta, ma perché i motori di ricerca lo dirigono automaticamente alle sue voci), ma non prende in considerazione la possibilità di contribuirvi per tre motivi principali: perché la ritiene di livello troppo basso nel proprio settore specialistico; perché ritiene sé stesso troppo incompetente in qualsiasi altro settore e perché non ha tempo da perdere in lavori che non assicurano né compensi economici né titoli utili alla carriera.» La reputazione di Wikipedia quale mezzo di consultazione è soggetta a discussioni di opposti orientamenti: da una parte elogiata per la sua libera distribuzione, libera compilazione e ampia gamma di argomenti trattati, dall'altra criticata per presunti pregiudizi sistemici (secondo cui vengono privilegiate le voci di interesse dei singoli contributori indipendentemente dalla loro oggettiva importanza), lacune su alcuni argomenti e mancanza di responsabilità e autorità in rapporto alle enciclopedie tradizionali.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Anche il concetto di ""enciclopedia"" di Wikipedia è oggetto di dibattito, a maggior ragione da quando essa ha incrementato la sua importanza.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Le critiche più frequenti riguardano una mancanza di affidabilità, conoscenza e autorevolezza.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"La critica più forte riguarda l'affidabilità in termini di contenuti; fermo restando la natura work in progress dell'opera ovvero la continua tendenza al miglioramento nel tempo in termini di completezza e affidabilità dei contenuti, al riguardo uno studio della rivista Nature del 2008, che ha messo a confronto la versione inglese di Wikipedia con la famosa enciclopedia Britannica, ha evidenziato una differenza minima in termini di errori tra le due (4 errori in media per ciascuna voce di Wikipedia e 3 per la Britannica).",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[42] Addetti ai lavori del mondo cartaceo (bibliotecari, accademici, redattori ed editori di enciclopedie classiche) considerano invece Wikipedia di scarsa o nulla utilità quale mezzo di consultazione.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Per contro altri ritengono Wikipedia di qualità sufficiente in almeno alcune aree, in questo sostenuti dal fatto che essa ha vinto un test comparativo proposto da c't, rivista tedesca di informatica.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Molti degli elogi le sono attribuiti per il fatto di essere sia a contenuto libero sia aperta alle modifiche di chiunque.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I redattori stessi di Wikipedia sono stati piuttosto attivi nel valutare, sia positivamente sia negativamente, l'enciclopedia.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Una forte critica, nel 2007 viene da Robert Cailliau — uno degli ideatori del web[43] — che ha affermato che Wikipedia «…rappresenta proprio ciò che non volevamo che diventasse il web»; questo perché Wikipedia concentra in un solo ""luogo"" un gran numero di informazioni, invece nelle menti degli ideatori vi era una struttura a rete, in cui la parte tecnica, ma anche le informazioni fossero distribuite equamente sui suoi nodi, in modo che se venisse a mancare uno di questi nodi non si formasse una voragine d'informazione.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[44] Di fatto Wikipedia funziona molto efficacemente come un aggregatore di informazioni e notizie provenienti da numerose fonti primarie (cartacee e web) di fronte all'enorme numero di informazioni disperse nel web, cresciute con il web stesso, stimolando allo stesso tempo la condivisione del sapere in rete e il senso di responsabilità.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Allo stesso tempo i difensori e fruitori ne esaltano la ""portabilità"" rispetto alle enciclopedie cartacee ovvero la disponibilità a portata di un ""click"".",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Per questo Wikipedia è stata usata dai media, da membri della comunità accademica e da altri come fonte informativa principale o secondaria.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Alcuni organi d'informazione hanno citato le voci di Wikipedia come fonte o le hanno segnalate tra le informazioni aggiuntive disponibili sul Web, in alcuni casi in modo reiterato.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Secondo gli elenchi tenuti dai contributori di Wikipedia, le sue voci sono state citate con maggiore frequenza nei media di contenuto informativo, e più raramente anche in studi accademici, libri, conferenze e aule giudiziarie.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ad esempio, il sito del Parlamento del Canada cita la voce inglese di Wikipedia sui matrimoni gay tra le letture consigliate riguardo al proprio progetto di legge C-38.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Alcuni utenti mantengono liste (incomplete) dei casi in cui Wikipedia è stata citata come fonte.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I critici sostengono che l'accesso in scrittura a chiunque renda Wikipedia un prodotto inaffidabile.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Wikipedia non contiene alcun processo formale e sistematico di revisione e, dunque, di controllo dei fatti: gli stessi contributori potrebbero non essere esperti negli argomenti di cui scrivono.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Il bibliotecario e consulente per Internet Philip Bradley dichiarò nel 2004 al britannico Guardian di non avere intenzione di utilizzare Wikipedia e di non essere «a conoscenza di un solo bibliotecario che lo farebbe.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Il problema principale è la mancanza di autorevolezza.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Per le pubblicazioni stampate, gli editori devono garantire che i loro dati siano attendibili in quanto il loro sostentamento dipende da ciò.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ma con qualcosa come questo, tutto ciò perde di significato».",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[45] Analogamente il direttore responsabile dell'Encyclopædia Britannica Ted Pappas disse al Guardian: «Il presupposto di Wikipedia è che il continuo miglioramento porterà alla perfezione.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tale presupposto non è assolutamente dimostrato».,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Nel discutere su Wikipedia come fonte accademica Danah Boyd, ricercatrice presso la School of Information Management and Systems (SIMS) dell'Università della California a Berkeley, scrisse nel 2005 che «[Wikipedia] non sarà mai un'enciclopedia, ma conterrà una vasta conoscenza piuttosto valida per diversi scopi».",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Alcuni articoli accademici sottoposti a revisione paritaria, come quelli pubblicati sulla rivista scientifica Science, hanno riportato dei riferimenti a voci di Wikipedia.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
L'atteggiamento del mondo scientifico verso Wikimedia come strumento di consultazione non è stato solo negativo.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Le voci di Wikipedia sono state citate nelle enhanced perspectives (abstract delle più recenti ed entusiasmanti ricerche scientifiche) disponibili on line sul sito di Science.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Il primo di tali abstract ad avere un link a Wikipedia fu A White Collar Protein Senses Blue Light (Linden, 2002), e da allora altre ne seguirono.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Tali collegamenti, tuttavia, sono proposti al lettore solo come letture supplementari e non come fonti usate dall'autore dell'articolo, e le enhanced perspectives non sono pensate per servire, esse stesse, da materiale di riferimento.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In un articolo del 2004, The Faith-Based Encyclopedia (L'enciclopedia basata sulla fiducia) l'ex direttore della Britannica Robert McHenry, criticò l'approccio wiki, sostenendo che «…per quanto vicina — in qualche momento della sua vita — al raggiungimento della credibilità, una voce di Wikipedia è sempre aperta a qualche ficcanaso poco informato o semi acculturato… L'utente che visita Wikipedia per apprendere qualche argomento, per confermare qualche dato di fatto, è piuttosto nella posizione dell'avventore di un bagno pubblico.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Potrebbe essere palesemente sporco, così che egli sa di dover fare molta attenzione, o potrebbe sembrare discretamente pulito, così che egli potrebbe farsi cullare dal falso senso di sicurezza.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ciò che certamente non può sapere è chi ha usato i servizi prima di lui».,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Per rispondere a tale critica sono stati proposti metodi per indicare l'origine del materiale nelle voci di Wikipedia.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"L'idea è di fornire una provenienza della fonte su ciascun intervallo del testo di una voce, e una provenienza temporale per indicarne l'annata.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In questo modo il lettore può conoscere «chi ha usato i servizi prima di lui» e quanto tempo la comunità ha impiegato per elaborare e giudicare le informazioni contenute in una voce allo scopo di fornire una calibratura sul ""senso di sicurezza"".",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Comunque, queste proposte riguardanti la provenienza sono abbastanza controverse.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Uno degli ideatori del progetto, Larry Sanger, criticò Wikipedia nel 2004, per la sua supposta filosofia anti-elitaria di attivo disprezzo per la competenza.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Il processo di redazione di Wikipedia presuppone che l'esposizione di una voce a molti utenti conduca, con il tempo di per sé, all'accuratezza.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Facendo riferimento alla Legge di Linus sullo sviluppo open source, Sanger aveva in passato sostenuto che «dati sufficienti occhi, tutti gli errori sono superficiali».",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Jōichi Itō, personaggio di spicco del mondo tecnologico, ha poi scritto, a proposito dell'autorità in Wikipedia, che «sebbene dipenda un po' dall'argomento, l'interrogativo è se qualcosa sia con tutta probabilità vera quando provenga da una fonte il cui curriculum suoni autorevole oppure da una fonte che sia stata esaminata da centinaia di migliaia di persone (con la capacità di commentare) e sia sopravvissuta».",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Al contrario, in un test informale sulla capacità di Wikipedia di individuare informazioni errate, l'autore sottolineò che il processo usato in Wikipedia «non è realmente un meccanismo in grado di verificare i fatti tanto quanto lo sarebbe un meccanismo di voto» e che un materiale che non apparisse apertamente falso verrebbe accettato come vero.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wikipedia è stata accusata di insufficienza nella conoscenza a causa della sua natura volontaria e di riflettere i pregiudizi sistemici dei suoi collaboratori.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Il redattore capo della Britannica, Dale Hoiberg, ha commentato che «le persone scrivono di cose alle quali sono interessate, perciò molti argomenti non vengono coperti e le notizie di attualità sono trattate con molto dettaglio.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Nell'edizione inglese di Wikipedia la voce sull'uragano Frances è lunga cinque volte quella sull'arte cinese, e la voce sulla soap opera Coronation Street è lunga il doppio di quella sul primo ministro inglese Tony Blair.» L'ex redattore capo di Nupedia, Larry Sanger, affermò nel 2004 che «quando si tratta di argomenti relativamente specializzati (al di fuori degli interessi di molti dei collaboratori), la credibilità del progetto è molto irregolare».",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Wikipedia è stata elogiata poiché, come wiki, permette alle voci di essere aggiornate o create in risposta ad avvenimenti di attualità.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Per esempio, la voce sul maremoto dell'Oceano Indiano nella sua edizione inglese venne citata spesso dalla stampa poco dopo l'episodio.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I suoi redattori hanno anche affermato che Wikipedia, come sito web è capace di includere voci su un più ampio numero di argomenti di quanto potrebbe fare un'enciclopedia stampata.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"La rivista di informatica tedesca c't nell'ottobre 2004 ha fatto un confronto tra le enciclopedie Brockhaus Premium, Microsoft Encarta e Wikipedia.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Degli esperti hanno valutato 66 voci in varie discipline.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Nel punteggio complessivo, Wikipedia ha ottenuto 3,6 punti su 5, la Brockhaus Premium 3,3 e Microsoft Encarta 3,1.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In un'analisi sulle enciclopedie online, i professori della Indiana University Emigh e Herring, hanno poi sostenuto che «Wikipedia apporta miglioramenti alle tradizionali fonti di informazione, specialmente per le aree in cui è forte, come tecnologia e avvenimenti d'attualità».",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Alla fine del 2005 è sorta una controversia dopo che il giornalista John Seigenthaler Sr. aveva notato come la sua biografia fosse stata vandalizzata inserendo informazioni false.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ciò ha portato alla decisione di restringere – nell'edizione di Wikipedia in inglese – la possibilità di creare nuove voci ai soli utenti registrati.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
La rivista scientifica Nature nel 2005 riportava (anche in risposta al caso Seigenthaler) i risultati di uno studio comparato secondo cui le voci scientifiche in Wikipedia erano comparabili in accuratezza a quelle presenti nell'Enciclopedia Britannica (sull'edizione inglese di Wikipedia furono riscontrati una media di 4 errori per voce contro i 3 della Britannica).,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[46][47][48] La ricerca di Nature fece notevole scalpore nei media, dai quali è stata spesso citata come dimostrazione dell'efficacia dei progetti basati sul crowdsourcing.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Secondo un nuovo studio condotto nel 2012 dalla società Epic e da alcuni ricercatori dell'università di Oxford, Wikipedia è divenuta più precisa, documentata e aggiornata rispetto alla Britannica.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[49][50] Tra il 28 dicembre 2005 e il 10 gennaio 2006 l'edizione in lingua italiana di Wikipedia è stata sottoposta a un esperimento da parte del settimanale L'espresso, che ha inserito volutamente quattro errori in altrettante voci dell'enciclopedia (Álvaro Recoba, Ugo Foscolo, Giovanni Spadolini, Georg Hegel) e una voce del tutto inventata su un inesistente poeta di nome Carlo Zamolli.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
La voce Álvaro Recoba è stata corretta in poco più di un'ora.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
La voce Georg Hegel è stata corretta dopo dieci giorni.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Le altre due voci contenenti gli inserimenti errati e la voce inventata sono state corrette solo dopo l'uscita del settimanale nelle edicole.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Come ulteriore esempio una voce intitolata Elia Spallanzani, del tutto inventata, inserita l'8 gennaio 2005 non è stata corretta fino al 19 maggio 2006: nel corso della procedura di cancellazione la voce è stata modificata in modo da chiarire che si trattava di una biografia immaginaria.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Nel suo pamphlet sulla specializzazione, frammentazione e disgregazione del sapere,[51] Lucio Russo conclude: «Non è facile prevedere l'esito dell'esperimento sociologico-culturale di massa di Wikipedia, ma credo che in ogni caso questo tentativo di ricostruire dal basso uno strumento condivisibile di conoscenza, al quale stanno partecipando milioni di volontari di tutto il mondo, costituisca un'esperienza da cui non si potrà prescindere in futuro e autorizza qualche timida speranza.» Wikipedia ha vinto due premi importanti nel maggio 2004: il primo è stato un Golden Nica per le Comunità Digitali all'interno del Prix Ars Electronica di Linz in Austria[52], in cui annualmente sono consegnati premi nel campo dell'arte elettronica ed interattiva, dell'animazione al computer, della cultura digitale e della musica.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Questo premio fu accompagnato da un finanziamento di 10.000 euro e da un invito a presenziare al PAE Cyberarts Festival di quell'anno.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Il secondo è stato un Webby Award (premio annuale per i migliori siti web) proposto dalla giuria per la categoria ""Comunità"".",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Wikipedia è anche stata nominata per il premio della categoria ""Migliori attività"".",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nel settembre 2004 l'edizione giapponese di Wikipedia ha ottenuto un Premio per la Creazione Web dalla Associazione Inserzionisti del Giappone.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Questo premio, normalmente consegnato a singole persone che si sono distinte per il loro contributo al web in giapponese, è stato ritirato da un collaboratore di lunga data, per conto del progetto.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Wikipedia ha ricevuto plausi da fonti giornalistiche quali BBC News, USA Today, The Economist, Newsweek, BusinessWeek, il Chicago Sun-Times, Time Magazine e Wired Magazine[senza fonte].",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A dicembre 2005 la Wikipedia in italiano ha ricevuto due premi nell'ambito del Premio WWW 2005, organizzato da Il Sole 24 Ore: Nell'edizione 2007 dello stesso premio si aggiudica la categoria Portali, siti di informazione & community.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[54] Nel 2009 il lancio di Wikipedia (avvenuto nel 2001) è stato inserito da Webby Awards nei 10 momenti più importanti per Internet nell'ultimo decennio (2000-2009).,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"[4] Altri progetti L’apprendimento automatico (nella letteratura di lingua anglosassone machine learning) è una branca dell'intelligenza artificiale che raccoglie metodi sviluppati negli ultimi decenni del XX secolo in varie comunità scientifiche, sotto diversi nomi quali: statistica computazionale, riconoscimento di pattern, reti neurali artificiali, filtraggio adattivo, teoria dei sistemi dinamici, elaborazione delle immagini, data mining, algoritmi adattivi, ecc; che utilizza metodi statistici per migliorare la performance di un algoritmo nell'identificare pattern nei dati.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Nell'ambito dell'informatica, l'apprendimento automatico è una variante alla programmazione tradizionale nella quale in una macchina si predispone l'abilità di apprendere qualcosa dai dati in maniera autonoma, senza istruzioni esplicite[1][2].",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Arthur Samuel, che coniò il termine nel 1959[3], in linea di principio identifica due approcci distinti.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Il primo metodo, indicato come rete neurale, sviluppa macchine ad apprendimento automatico per impiego generale il cui comportamento è appreso da una rete di commutazione connessa casualmente, a seguito di una routine di apprendimento basata su ricompensa e punizione (apprendimento per rinforzo).",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Il secondo metodo, più specifico, consiste nel riprodurre l'equivalente di una rete altamente organizzata progettata per imparare solo attività specifiche.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"La seconda procedura, che necessita di supervisione e richiede la riprogrammazione per ogni nuova applicazione, è molto più efficiente dal punto di vista computazionale.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"L'apprendimento automatico è strettamente legato al riconoscimento di pattern e alla teoria computazionale dell'apprendimento[4] ed esplora lo studio e la costruzione di algoritmi che possano apprendere da un insieme di dati e fare delle predizioni su questi,[5] costruendo in modo induttivo un modello basato su dei campioni.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"L'apprendimento automatico viene impiegato in quei campi dell'informatica nei quali progettare e programmare algoritmi espliciti è impraticabile; tra le possibili applicazioni citiamo il filtraggio delle email per evitare spam, l'individuazione di intrusioni in una rete o di intrusi che cercano di violare dati,[6] il riconoscimento ottico dei caratteri[7], i motori di ricerca e la visione artificiale.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"L'apprendimento automatico è collegato, e spesso si sovrappone, alla statistica computazionale, che si occupa dell'elaborazione di predizioni tramite l'uso di computer.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"L'apprendimento automatico è anche fortemente legato all'ottimizzazione matematica, che fornisce metodi, teorie e domini di applicazione a questo campo.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Per usi commerciali, l'apprendimento automatico è conosciuto come analisi predittiva.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"L'apprendimento automatico si sviluppa con lo studio dell'intelligenza artificiale, e vi è strettamente collegato: infatti già dai primi tentativi di definire l'intelligenza artificiale come disciplina accademica, alcuni ricercatori si erano mostrati interessati alla possibilità che le macchine imparassero dai dati.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Questi ricercatori, in particolare Marvin Minsky, Arthur Samuel e Frank Rosenblatt, provarono ad avvicinarsi al problema sia attraverso vari metodi formali, sia con quelle che vengono definite reti neurali nei tardi anni '50.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Le reti neurali erano allora costituite da singoli percettroni e da modelli matematici derivati dal modello lineare generalizzato della statistica, come l'ADALINE di Widrow[8][9].",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Si provò a sfruttare anche ragionamenti probabilistici, in particolare nelle diagnosi mediche automatiche[10].",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sempre negli anni '50, Alan Turing propose l'idea di una macchina che apprende, ovvero in grado di imparare e dunque diventare intelligente.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
La proposta specifica di Turing anticipa gli algoritmi genetici[11].,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Tuttavia già dalla metà degli anni '50 lo studio dell'intelligenza artificiale si stava concentrando su approcci logici di tipo knowledge-based, nota oggi sotto il nome di GOFAI, causando un distacco tra lo studio dell'IA e quello dell'apprendimento automatico.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sistemi di tipo probabilistico erano invasi di problemi sia teoretici sia pratici in termini di acquisizione e rappresentazione dei dati[10].,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Negli anni Ottanta, i sistemi esperti dominavano il campo dell'IA, e i sistemi basati sulla statistica non venivano più studiati[12].",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Lo studio dell'apprendimento simbolico e knowledge-based continuò nell'ambito dell'IA, portando a sviluppare la programmazione logica induttiva, ma ora la ricerca più prettamente statistica si svolgeva al di fuori del campo vero e proprio dell'intelligenza artificiale, nel riconoscimento di pattern e nell'information retrieval[10].",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Un altro motivo per cui lo studio dell'apprendimento automatico fu abbandonato fu la pubblicazione del libro Perceptrons: an introduction to computational geometry di Marvin Minsky e Seymour Papert, che vi descrivevano alcune delle limitazioni dei percettroni e delle reti neurali.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"La ricerca sulle reti neurali subì un significativo rallentamento a causa dell'interpretazione del libro, che le descriveva come intrinsecamente limitate[13][14].",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Anche la linea di ricerca sulle reti neurali continuò al di fuori del campo dell'IA, portata avanti da ricercatori provenienti da altre discipline quali Hopfield, Rumelhart, Hinton e Fukushima.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Il loro successo principale fu a metà degli anni '80 con la riscoperta della backpropagation[10] e della self-organization[15].,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"L'apprendimento automatico, sviluppatosi come campo di studi separato dall'IA classica, cominciò a rifiorire negli anni '90.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Il suo obiettivo cambiò dall'ottenere l'intelligenza artificiale ad affrontare problemi risolvibili di natura pratica.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Distolse inoltre la propria attenzione dagli approcci simbolici che aveva ereditato dall'IA, e si diresse verso metodi e modelli presi in prestito dalla statistica e dalla teoria della probabilità[12].",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"L'apprendimento automatico ha inoltre beneficiato dalla nascita di Internet, che ha reso l'informazione digitale più facilmente reperibile e distribuibile.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Tom M. Mitchell ha fornito la definizione più citata di apprendimento automatico nel suo libro ""Machine Learning"": ""Si dice che un programma apprende dall'esperienza E con riferimento a alcune classi di compiti T e con misurazione della performance P, se le sue performance nel compito T, come misurato da P, migliorano con l'esperienza E.""[16] In poche parole, si potrebbe semplificare dicendo che un programma apprende se c'è un miglioramento delle prestazioni dopo un compito svolto.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Questa definizione di Mitchell è rilevante poiché fornisce una definizione operativa dell'apprendimento automatico, invece che in termini cognitivi.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Fornendo questa definizione, Mitchell di fatto segue la proposta che Alan Turing fece nel suo articolo ""Computing Machinery and Intelligence"", sostituendo la domanda ""Le macchine possono pensare?""",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"con la domanda ""Le macchine possono fare quello che noi (in quanto entità pensanti) possiamo fare?""[17].",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"L'obiettivo principe dell'apprendimento automatico è che una macchina sia in grado di generalizzare dalla propria esperienza[18], ossia che sia in grado di svolgere ragionamenti induttivi.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In questo contesto, per generalizzazione si intende l'abilità di una macchina di portare a termine in maniera accurata esempi o compiti nuovi, che non ha mai affrontato, dopo aver fatto esperienza su un insieme di dati di apprendimento.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Gli esempi di addestramento (in inglese chiamati training examples) si assume provengano da una qualche distribuzione di probabilità, generalmente sconosciuta e considerata rappresentativa dello spazio delle occorrenze del fenomeno da apprendere; la macchina ha il compito di costruire un modello probabilistico generale dello spazio delle occorrenze, in maniera tale da essere in grado di produrre previsioni sufficientemente accurate quando sottoposta a nuovi casi.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
L'analisi computazionale degli algoritmi di apprendimento automatico e delle loro prestazioni è una branca dell'Informatica teorica chiamata teoria dell'apprendimento.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Dato che gli esempi di addestramento sono insiemi finiti di dati e non c'è modo di sapere l'evoluzione futura di un modello, la teoria dell'apprendimento non offre alcuna garanzia sulle prestazioni degli algoritmi.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"D'altro canto, è piuttosto comune che tali prestazioni siano vincolate da limiti probabilistici.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Il bias-variance tradeoff è uno dei modi di quantificare l'errore di generalizzazione.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Affinché la generalizzazione offra le migliori prestazioni possibili, la complessità dell'ipotesi induttiva deve essere pari alla complessità della funzione sottostante i dati.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Se l'ipotesi è meno complessa della funzione, allora il modello manifesta underfitting.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Quando la complessità del modello viene aumentata in risposta, allora l'errore di apprendimento diminuisce.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Al contrario invece se l'ipotesi è troppo complessa, allora il modello manifesta overfitting e la generalizzazione sarà più scarsa[19].",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Oltre ai limiti di prestazioni, i teorici dell'apprendimento studiano la complessità temporale e la fattibilità dell'apprendimento stesso.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Una computazione è considerata fattibile se può essere svolta in tempo polinomiale.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I compiti dell'apprendimento automatico vengono tipicamente classificati in tre ampie categorie, a seconda della natura del ""segnale"" utilizzato per l'apprendimento o del ""feedback"" disponibile al sistema di apprendimento.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Queste categorie, anche dette paradigmi, sono:[10] A metà strada tra l'apprendimento supervisionato e quello non supervisionato c'è l'apprendimento semi-supervisionato, nel quale l'insegnante fornisce un dataset incompleto per l'allenamento, cioè un insieme di dati per l'allenamento tra i quali ci sono dati senza il rispettivo output desiderato.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"La trasduzione è un caso speciale di questo principio, nel quale l'intero insieme delle istanze del problema è noto durante l'apprendimento, eccetto la parte degli output desiderati che è mancante.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Un'altra categorizzazione dei compiti dell'apprendimento automatico si rileva quando si considera l'output desiderato del sistema di apprendimento automatico.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[20] L'apprendimento automatico e la statistica sono discipline strettamente collegate.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Secondo Michael I. Jordan, le idee dell'apprendimento automatico, dai principi metodologici agli strumenti teorici, sono stati sviluppati prima in statistica[22].",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jordan ha anche suggerito il termine data science come nome con cui chiamare l'intero campo di studi[22].,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Leo Breiman ha distinto due paradigmi statistici di modellazione: modello basato sui dati e modello basato sugli algoritmi[23], dove ""modello basato sugli algoritmi"" indica approssimativamente algoritmi di apprendimento automatico come la foresta casuale.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Alcuni statistici hanno adottato metodi provenienti dall'apprendimento automatico, il che ha portato alla creazione di una disciplina combinata chiamata ""apprendimento statistico""[24].",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"L'apprendimento automatico viene a volte unito al data mining,[25] che si focalizza maggiormente sull'analisi esplorativa dei dati ed utilizza principalmente il paradigma di apprendimento chiamato ""apprendimento non supervisionato""[26].",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Invece, l'apprendimento automatico può essere anche supervisionato[27].",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"L'apprendimento automatico e il data mining infatti si sovrappongono in modo significativo, ma mentre l'apprendimento automatico si concentra sulla previsione basata su proprietà note apprese dai dati, il data mining si concentra sulla scoperta di proprietà prima sconosciute nei dati.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Il data mining sfrutta i metodi dell'apprendimento automatico, ma con obiettivi differenti; d'altro canto, l'apprendimento automatico utilizza i metodi di data mining come metodi di apprendimento non supervisionato o come passi di preprocessing per aumentare l'accuratezza dell'apprendimento.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Gran parte della confusione tra le due comunità di ricerca scaturisce dall'assunzione di base del loro operato: nell'apprendimento automatico, le prestazioni sono generalmente valutate in base all'abilità di riprodurre conoscenza già acquisita, mentre in data mining il compito chiave è la scoperta di conoscenza che prima non si aveva.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
L'apprendimento automatico ha legami molto stretti con l'ottimizzazione: molti problemi di apprendimento sono formulati come la minimizzazione di una qualche funzione di costo su un insieme di esempi di apprendimento.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
La funzione di costo (o funzione di perdita) rappresenta la discrepanza tra le previsioni del modello che si sta addestrando e le istanze del problema reale.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Le differenze tra i due campi (l'apprendimento automatico e l'ottimizzazione) sorgono dall'obiettivo della generalizzazione: mentre gli algoritmi di ottimizzazione possono minimizzare la perdita su un insieme di apprendimento, l'apprendimento automatico si preoccupa di minimizzare la perdita su campioni mai visti dalla macchina[28].",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"La risoluzione automatica di problemi avviene, nel campo dell'informatica, in due modi differenti: tramite paradigmi di hard computing o tramite paradigmi di soft computing.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Per hard computing si intende la risoluzione di un problema tramite l'esecuzione di un algoritmo ben definito e decidibile.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"La maggior parte dei paradigmi di hard computing sono metodi ormai consolidati, ma presentano alcuni lati negativi: infatti richiedono sempre un modello analitico preciso e definibile, e spesso un alto tempo di computazione.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Le tecniche di soft computing d'altro canto antepongono il guadagno nella comprensione del comportamento di un sistema a scapito della precisione, spesso non necessaria.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I paradigmi di soft computing si basano su due principi[29]: L'apprendimento automatico si avvale delle tecniche di soft computing.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"La programmazione logica induttiva (anche ILP, dall'inglese inductive logic programming) è un approccio all'apprendimento di regole che usa la programmazione logica come rappresentazione uniforme per gli esempi di input, per la conoscenza di base della macchina, e per le ipotesi.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Data una codifica della (nota) conoscenza di base e un insieme di esempi rappresentati come fatti in una base di dati logica, un sistema ILP deriva un programma logico ipotetico da cui conseguono tutti gli esempi positivi, e nessuno di quelli negativi.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"La programmazione induttiva è un campo simile che considera ogni tipo di linguaggio di programmazione per rappresentare le ipotesi invece che soltanto la programmazione logica, come ad esempio programmi funzionali.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
L'albero di decisione è un metodo di apprendimento per approssimazione di una funzione obiettivo discreta in cui l'elemento che apprende è rappresentato da un albero di decisione.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gli alberi di decisione possono essere rappresentati da un insieme di regole if-else per migliorare la leggibilità umana.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"L'apprendimento automatico basato su regole di associazione è un metodo di apprendimento che identifica, apprende ed evolve delle ""regole"" con l'intento di immagazzinare, manipolare e applicare conoscenza.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
La caratteristica principale di questo tipo di apprendimento è l'identificazione ed utilizzo di un insieme di regole relazionali che rappresenta nel suo insieme la conoscenza catturata dal sistema.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ciò si pone in controtendenza con altri tipi di apprendimento automatico che normalmente identificano un singolo modello che può essere applicato universalmente ad ogni istanza per riuscire a fare su di essa una previsione[30].,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gli approcci dell'apprendimento basato su regole di associazione includono il sistema immunitario artificiale.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Una rete neurale artificiale è un sistema adattivo che cambia la sua struttura basata su informazioni esterne o interne che scorrono attraverso la rete durante la fase di apprendimento.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In termini pratici le reti neurali sono strutture non-lineari di dati statistici organizzate come strumenti di modellazione.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Esse possono essere utilizzate per simulare relazioni complesse tra ingressi e uscite che altre funzioni analitiche non riescono a rappresentare.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Inoltre esse sono robuste agli errori presenti nel training data.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gli algoritmi genetici forniscono un approccio all'apprendimento che è liberamente ispirato all'evoluzione simulata.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
La ricerca di una soluzione del problema inizia con una popolazione di soluzioni iniziale.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I membri della popolazione attuale danno luogo a una popolazione di nuova generazione per mezzo di operazioni quali la mutazione casuale e crossover, che sono modellati sui processi di evoluzione biologica.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ad ogni passo, le soluzioni della popolazione attuale sono valutate rispetto a una determinata misura di fitness, con le ipotesi più adatte selezionate probabilisticamente come semi per la produzione della prossima generazione.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gli algoritmi genetici sono stati applicati con successo a una varietà di compiti di apprendimento e di altri problemi di ottimizzazione.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ad esempio, essi sono stati usati per imparare raccolte di norme per il controllo del robot e per ottimizzare la topologia dei parametri di apprendimento per reti neurali artificiali.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Il ragionamento bayesiano fornisce un approccio probabilistico di inferenza.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Esso si basa sul presupposto che le quantità di interesse sono disciplinate da distribuzioni di probabilità e che le decisioni ottimali possono essere prese a seguito dell'analisi di queste probabilità insieme ai dati osservati.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Nell'ambito dell'apprendimento automatico, la teoria Bayesiana è importante perché fornisce un approccio quantitativo per valutare le prove a sostegno dell'ipotesi alternativa.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Il Ragionamento bayesiano fornisce la base per l'apprendimento negli algoritmi che manipolano direttamente le probabilità.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Macchine a vettori di supporto (Support Vector Machine, SVM) sono un insieme di metodi di apprendimento supervisionato usati per la classificazione e la regressione di pattern.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Dato un insieme di esempi di addestramento, ciascuno contrassegnato come appartenente a due possibili categorie, un algoritmo di addestramento SVM costruisce un modello in grado di prevedere a quale categoria deve appartenere un nuovo esempio di input.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"La discesa dei prezzi per l'hardware e lo sviluppo di GPU per uso personale negli ultimi anni hanno contribuito allo sviluppo del concetto di apprendimento profondo, che consiste nello sviluppare livelli nascosti multipli nelle reti neurali artificiali.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Questo approccio tenta di modellizzare il modo in cui il cervello umano processa luce e suoni e li interpreta in vista e udito.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Alcune delle applicazioni più affermate dell'apprendimento profondo sono la visione artificiale e il riconoscimento vocale[31].,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"La cluster analisi, o clustering, è in grado di rilevare similarità strutturali tra le osservazioni di un dataset attraverso l'assegnazione di un insieme di osservazioni in sottogruppi (cluster) di elementi tra loro omogenei[1].",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Il clustering è un metodo di apprendimento non supervisionato, e una tecnica comune per l'analisi statistica dei dati.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tutti i sistemi di riconoscimento vocale di maggior successo utilizzano metodi di apprendimento automatico.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ad esempio, il SPHINXsystem[32] impara le strategie di altoparlanti specifici per riconoscere i suoni primitivi (fonemi) e le parole del segnale vocale osservato.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Metodi di apprendimento basati su reti neurali e su modelli di Markov nascosti sono efficaci per la personalizzazione automatica di vocabolari, caratteristiche del microfono, rumore di fondo, ecc.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Metodi di apprendimento automatico sono stati usati per addestrare i veicoli controllati da computer.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ad esempio, il sistema ALVINN[33] ha usato le sue strategie per imparare a guidare senza assistenza a 70 miglia all'ora per 90 miglia su strade pubbliche, tra le altre auto.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Con tecniche simili sono possibili applicazioni in molti problemi di controllo basato su sensori.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Metodi di apprendimento automatico sono stati applicati ad una varietà di banche dati di grandi dimensioni per imparare regolarità generali implicite nei dati.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ad esempio, algoritmi di apprendimento basati su alberi di decisione sono stati usati dalla NASA per classificare oggetti celesti a partire dal secondo Palomar Observatory Sky Survey[34].",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Questo sistema è oggi utilizzato per classificare automaticamente tutti gli oggetti nel Sky Survey, che si compone di tre terabyte di dati immagine.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I programmi per computer di maggior successo per il gioco del backgammon sono basati su algoritmi di apprendimento.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ad esempio, il miglior programma di computer al mondo per backgammon, TD-Gammon[35], ha sviluppato la sua strategia giocando oltre un milione di partite di prova contro se stesso.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tecniche simili hanno applicazioni in molti problemi pratici in cui gli spazi di ricerca molto rilevanti devono essere esaminati in modo efficiente.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
L'apprendimento automatico solleva un numero di problematiche etiche.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I sistemi addestrati con insiemi di dati faziosi o pregiudizievoli possono esibire questi pregiudizi quando vengono interpellati: in questo modo possono essere digitalizzati pregiudizi culturali quali il razzismo istituzionale e il classismo[36].,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Di conseguenza la raccolta responsabile dei dati può diventare un aspetto critico dell'apprendimento automatico.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In ragione dell'innata ambiguità dei linguaggi naturali, le macchine addestrate su corpi linguistici necessariamente apprenderanno questa ambiguità[37].",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Altri progetti

"quindi oggi impareremo 10 nuove parole intelligenti, i loro significati, parole di base e frasi di esempio, quindi andiamo avanti ehi tutti, questo è e state guardando.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
e in questo video ti darò 10 parole intelligenti per l'uso quotidiano e alla fine di questo video.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ti darò anche un consiglio intelligente per suonare un numero di parole intelligenti davvero fluente.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
uno è sommerso palude significa annegamento o inondazione ma palude è spesso usato nel contesto del lavoro come i ' Sono sommerso dal lavoro Ho troppo lavoro da fare Sono stato sommerso dal lavoro per tutta la settimana Ho avuto a malapena il tempo di respirare ora diamo un'occhiata alla radice di questa parola.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"palude è un pezzo di zona umida e se qualcuno cammina nel posto sbagliato su una palude potrebbe facilmente annegare e la forma verbale di palude significa affondare, quindi ecco come puoi usare questa parola.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
diciamo che hai molti incarichi e hai un test in arrivo e i tuoi amici vengono da te e dicono.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hey perché non esci con noi puoi dire loro che mi dispiace ma sono sommerso dal lavoro o sono sommerso alcune altre parole che puoi usare al posto di sommerso se ho troppo fare.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ci sono troppe cose nel mio piatto che sto affogando nel lavoro.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"sono sommerso da incarichi, la parola intelligente numero due è catch-22 ora sono sicuro che tu ' Ho sentito questa parola prima di catch-22 significa una situazione impossibile in cui non puoi fare una cosa a meno che tu non abbia fatto l'altra e non puoi fare l'altra perché non hai fatto la prima.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ti ho confuso, quindi lascia che ti faccia alcuni esempi una situazione di cattura è quando non ottieni un lavoro senza avere esperienza lavorativa.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ma non puoi fare esperienza finché non ottieni un lavoro catch-22 è stato coniato da joseph heller nel suo famoso libro con lo stesso nome catch-22 quando descriveva alcune regole contraddittorie che erano applicabili ai soldati durante la seconda guerra mondiale.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
un altro esempio di catch-22 è che hai bisogno di un prestito bancario perché non ne hai abbastanza.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"soldi ma non otterresti quel prestito bancario a meno che non provi alla banca che hai abbastanza soldi, quindi la prossima volta che sei bloccato in una situazione difficile ricorda.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
per usare la parola catch-22.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
e ottieni questi sguardi ammirati dai tuoi amici altre parole che puoi usare al posto di catch-22 sono paradosso o dilemma parola intelligente.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
il numero tre è soave soave soave significa essere sofisticato per essere educato in bilico e cool.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ben educato la parola suave ha diverse origini ma un'origine molto interessante della parola è che significa esempio di degustazione piacevole o dolce.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
è così equilibrato e soave soprattutto di fronte alle signore o Barack Obama è così gentile e raffinato ora ricorda quando sei a una festa la prossima volta e vedi questa persona che è così.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"educato, colto e sofisticato.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
non dimenticare di dire ehi chi è quel ragazzo soave là fuori nell'angolo che usa questa parola renderà immediatamente il tuo vocabolario.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
molto soave così intelligente la parola numero quattro è atroce atroce la parola atroce significa qualcosa di veramente brutto orribile terribile crudele spaventoso offensivo atroce ha una radice latina chiamata .che significa paura crudele o terribile alcuni esempi della parola atroce sono i recenti episodi di stupro a Delhi sono stati atroci o vengono curati i prigionieri.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in modo atroce a volte nelle carceri atroce è usato anche nella vita di tutti i giorni per parlare di qualche malefatta comune e si vuole esagerare.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
per esempio le sue maniere a tavola erano atroci o il suo senso dell'abbigliamento è così atroce o la sua grammatica è atroce.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
quindi la prossima volta che sentirai parlare di un atto orribile al telegiornale ricordati di farlo.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"osserva e dì che questo è un atto atroce, la parola intelligente numero 5 è stupenda, stupenda, stupenda, significa stupefacente, stupefacente.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ora usiamo spesso la parola fantastico qui ' È un'altra parola che puoi usare al posto di fantastico stupendo per esempio oggi ho ottenuto un punteggio stupendo nel mio test, il che significa che ho ottenuto un punteggio molto alto o. ho ottenuto un punteggio quasi perfetto, la parola stupendo ha radici latine classiche dalla parola che significa.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
essere sbalordito così stupendo è usato per descrivere qualcosa che è straordinariamente buono per esempio lei sembra stupenda con quel vestito o che vista stupenda da questo balcone o sto leggendo questo libro stupendo che non riesco a mettere giù e tu vai e raccontare.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i tuoi amici che è questo stupendo canale per studenti e alcune altre parole che puoi usare invece di stupendi sono incredibilmente fantastici o eccezionalmente bravi ok quindi prima di continuare con le cinque parole equilibrate in questo video ricordati di mettere un commento sotto questo video.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
per dirmi quale di queste dieci parole era la tua parola intelligente preferita numero sei è in una soluzione in una soluzione significa essere in una situazione problematica per esempio ragazzo sono in una situazione perché ho fatto piani con due amici diversi per questo sera.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ho perso il telefono e sono in difficoltà o il nostro autobus si è rotto stamattina e io sono in difficoltà il mio amico si rivolge sempre a me per chiedere aiuto quando è in difficoltà e quando va bene se ne dimentica.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"così la prossima volta che prendi i compiti di matematica a scuola, ad esempio, e se hai lasciato il tuo libro di matematica a scuola, puoi dire ai tuoi amici che sei in un vero problema ora potresti pensare che la parola aggiustare abbia qualcosa da fare con la riparazione di qualcosa.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ma no in una soluzione significa essere in una situazione problematica altre parole che puoi usare invece che in una correzione sono io sono in una zuppa o io Sono in un pasticcio o sono in un punto di fastidio o semplicemente sono in un posto La parola intelligente numero 7 è flummox flummox significa confondere qualcuno.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"così tanto che dimenticano cosa fare ora confuso tende ad essere una parola abusata quindi invece di quello perché non usi flummox, ad esempio il ragazzo sembrava completamente sconcertato quando l'insegnante gli faceva una domanda in classe o il cane era sconcertato guardando al proprio riflesso nello specchio o il turista era sconcertato dalle diverse usanze che.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ha incontrato durante i suoi viaggi o in un colloquio quando le è stato chiesto perché dovremmo assumerti, sembrava completamente sconcertata, quindi la prossima volta se ti confondi su qualsiasi domanda, ad esempio in un esame, allora tu.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
posso sempre dirlo perché non avevo Sono stato preparato molto bene per l'esame sono rimasto sconcertato da alcune delle domande altre parole che puoi usare invece di sconcertato sono perplesso perplesso o perplesso La parola intelligente numero otto è rendezvous rendezvous rendezvous.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"è un modo molto francese di dire appuntamento o appuntamento, ad esempio ho un appuntamento con i miei amici a pranzo di sabato o ho intenzione di incontrarmi con i miei amici al centro commerciale per i film rendezvous può essere usato sia come sostantivo che come verbo per esempio.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ho un appuntamento con i miei amici stasera o domani ci incontrerò con i miei amici.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in Francia il rendezvous precedente era usato dall'esercito per indicare un luogo di incontro per le truppe, ora c'è qualcosa di leggermente eccitante e segreto nella parola rendezvous anche adesso, quindi puoi usare rendezvous per qualsiasi riunione.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"in generale ma ha vinto ' Non è molto appropriato per un incontro ufficiale, quindi se hai un appuntamento forse puoi sicuramente dire che una parola intelligente rendezvous numero 9 è ottuso ottuso ottuso è un insulto che useresti quando stai cercando di chiamare qualcuno stupido o non intelligente.",Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
o ottuso ora hai sentito la parola ottuso in geometria angolo ottuso e angolo acuto quindi un angolo ottuso è un angolo maggiore di 90 gradi ma inferiore a 180 gradi.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
e un angolo acuto è questo angolo acuto inferiore a 90 gradi così acuto come una parola è usata per denotare acuto e quindi anche mentalmente acuto e ottuso denota smussato e quindi anche un po 'lento nella mente quindi frasi di esempio con ottuso sono l'uomo era così ottuso che ha dato via la sua password a un falso chiamante o al bambino ottuso.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
non era in grado.,Italian,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Neredeyse bir kuşunki gibi küçük gözleri vardı ve diğerinin kocaman bir burnu vardı, onun yanında olmak istemezdim.",Turkish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"hapşırdığında oh oh ve son durak hayır artık duymak istemiyorum tüm görebildiğim o adamların gerçekten iyi olduğuydu canım, bu güzelliği bilmelisin.",Turkish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Prens ya da şövalye gibi birini hak ettiğimi anlaman gereken her şey anne değil mi?,Turkish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Ve biliyorsunuz ki en iyi yanı, benim de altın renginde olan gelinliğimi giydiğim zamandı tabii ki herkes sadece bana narsizaya bakıyordu, bu rüya hakkında şaşırtıcı bir şey yok.",Turkish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"çok egoist bir rüyaydı anne, ne dediğini bilmiyorsun, bu rüya benim burada evde yediğim türden daha büyük yiyeceğe ihtiyacım olduğunu anlamamı sağladı altından yapılan ekmekten.",Turkish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Zavallı nergis annenin kızı ve nasıl olduğu hakkında çok endişelendiğini bir düşünün.,Turkish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ben iyi talihlerin meleğiyim kızınızın adı ve güzelliği burada dünya çapında tanınıyor size bir hediye getirdim ama onu çok az tanıyorsunuz onunla gidemezsiniz.,Turkish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ah aptal o zengin ve yakışıklı daha ne isteyebilirim ki senin teklifini kabul ediyorum.,Turkish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ve bununla birlikte arabasına bindi ve annesiyle vedalaşmadan melekle birlikte yolculuk ederken, araba aniden büyülü bir geçide girdi ve arabanın muazzam bir şekilde çarptığı fırtınalı bir bölgeden geçti.",Turkish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"çok korkmuştu, endişelenme canım, tam da bu vagonun başka bir kapıdan geçip garaj yoluna ulaştığını söylediğinde, bunların hepsi yakında bitecek.",Turkish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"kocaman ve görkemli bir altın şatodan Narcisa, gördüğü tüm güzelliğe hayret etti o kadar çok zenginliği hak ettiğimi biliyordum, onu beğeneceğinizi biliyordum, burada en güzel elbiselerden en lezzetli yiyeceklere kadar bulacağınız her şeyi bulacaksınız.",Turkish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sarayımda yemeklerden iyi bahsetmişken, o yolculuktan sonra gerçekten acıktım Açlıktan ölüyorum, o lezzetli yiyeceklerden herhangi birini alabilir miyim elbette burada et kokulu melisa sana ne istersen alacak senin hakkında çok şey duydum seni zavallı canım açsın değil mi gelip yemek masasına gidelim ve Sana biraz yiyecek alacağım, teşekkür ederim yemek odasına gittiler ve masanın üzerinde narcisa'nın şimdiye kadar gördüğü en şaşırtıcı yiyecekler vardı, çünkü reçel yapılır.",Turkish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Yakutların zümrüt salataları ve oradaki ekmek altın altın ekmekten yapılmıştır Bu reçel, bir dilim aldığı ekmekle ne kadar güzel görünecek ve tadı güzel olacaktır.",Turkish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"burada biraz altın patates deneyin, gerçekten çok iyiler ve benimle evlendikten sonra.",Turkish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"bunların hepsini yemek zorundasın, süslü şeyleri sevdiğini düşündüm hayır seninle evlenmek istemiyorum eve gitmek istiyorum.",Turkish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
anneme eve gitmeme izin ver melissa ve terrence birbirlerine baktı ve güzelce göz kırptı.,Turkish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Eğer gerçekten istediğin buysa seni eve götürürüm terrence ağlayarak mutsuz olur.,Turkish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"narsis, arabanın içinde eve vardığında yaptığı seçimler hakkında derinlemesine düşünmeye başladı.",Turkish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
evde oturan annesine sarılmak için koştu hüzünlü abla o tatlı kızım seni bir daha göremeyeceğimi sandım.,Turkish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"oh anne seni çok seviyorum ve haklıydın ve zenginlik her şey değil, ben onu yiyemediğim için altın ekmek faydasızdı ve adam olsa bile.",Turkish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"o yakışıklıydı, beni hiç umursamıyordu ama canım, başkalarına tam olarak böyle davrandığının farkında mısın, biliyorum, davranış şeklim için çok üzgünüm anne oh hayır, gördüğünden beri sorun değil.",Turkish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hatan ne oldu o günden itibaren sana güzel bir şeyler besleyelim.,Turkish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
narcisa ilk başta mücadele ettiği yollarını değiştirdi ama yavaşça ve sabırla bir gün çok daha güzel olmaya başladı mellie ve terry tekrar marian ile buluşmaya geldi oh merhaba ikiniz o yüzden anlat bize marian.,Turkish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nature  är en framstående brittisk vetenskaplig veckotidskrift som började utges 4 november 1869 och grundades av Norman Lockyer.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Den är världens mest citerade interdisciplinära vetenskapliga tidskrift.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[3] Fler än 1 700 artiklar har över åren författats av drygt 275 nobelpristagare.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[1] De flesta vetenskapliga tidskrifter är numera högt specialiserade men Nature är bland ett fåtal tidskrifter (veckotidskrifterna Science and Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences är också framstående exempel) som fortfarande publicerar originalartiklar inom ett brett spektrum av vetenskapliga områden.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Det är många vetenskapliga områden inom vilka viktiga nya framsteg publiceras antingen i artikelform eller som brev i Nature.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wikipedia (svenskt uttal: [vɪkɪ'peːdɪa]) är en wiki och en mångspråkig webbaserad encyklopedi.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Den har i huvudsak fritt och öppet innehåll som utvecklas av sina användare, ofta benämnda wikipedianer.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[2] Den består till stor del av referat av källor skrivna av experter.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Wikipedia lanserades den 15 januari 2001 av Jimmy Wales och Larry Sanger, ursprungligen i en engelskspråkig version, och är det mest besökta uppslagsverket på internet.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Svenskspråkiga Wikipedia startades den 23 maj 2001.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wikipedia är (2020) rankad som världens trettonde och Sveriges åttonde mest besökta webbplats enligt Alexa.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[1] Wikipedia drivs av den icke-vinstinriktade stiftelsen Wikimedia Foundation med stöd av privata donatorer.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Projektet bygger på wikiprogramvaran Mediawiki, som är uteslutande fri och har öppen källkod.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Wikipedia grundades 15 januari 2001 av internetentreprenören Jimmy Wales och filosofen Larry Sanger, båda knutna till Wales internetföretag Bomis.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"De hade under år 2000 försökt starta uppslagsverket Nupedia, vilket dock begränsades av strikta krav på skribenterna.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[3] Genom att använda wikitekniken, det vill säga en sökbar webbplats där sidorna enkelt och snabbt kan redigeras av besökarna, lyckades man få igång skrivandet.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Wikipedia var från början enbart engelskspråkigt, men 15 mars 2001 togs initiativet till flera språk.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[4] Först ut var tyska,[5] tätt följt av katalanska och japanska.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dessa tre var i gång före utgången av mars.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Den 11 maj 2001 lades ytterligare nio stora språk till.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[6] Före utgången av 2001 fanns Wikipedia på 18 språk.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Engelskspråkiga Wikipedia har hela tiden varit störst och hade i december 2019 5,9 miljoner artiklar.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Den första redigeringen gjordes av Bomis kontorskonto den 15 januari 2001 klockan 20:27 på sidan HomePage som då var namnet på förstasidan.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Klockan 20:52 skapades den första artikeln, WikiPedia, av samma användare.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Namnet ""wikipedia"" myntades av Larry Sanger[7] och är en sammanslagning av wiki, som är hawaiiska och betyder snabb[8] och encyclopedia, från grekiskans enkyklios paideia, ordagrant ""rundad bildning"" eller ""kunskaper som formar en krets"", i betydelsen ""allmänbildning"".[9].",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Svenska var det andra mindre språket (efter katalanska) som fick en egen Wikipedia, och första redigeringen gjordes 23 maj 2001 av Linus Tolke.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10] Den äldsta bevarade startsidan[11] för Svenskspråkiga Wikipedia är från 10 juli 2001.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Svenskspråkiga Wikipedia var dock i stort sett inaktiv till november 2002.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wikipedia finns idag tillgänglig på 317[12] olika språk.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"269 språkversioner hade i september 2020 över ettusen artiklar, och 30 språk hade då fler än en miljon artiklar.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[13] Den engelskspråkiga versionen är störst, idag med 6 238 145 artiklar, 998 856 599 redigeringar sedan start och 141 020 aktiva bidragsgivare under den senaste månaden.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[12] Därefter följde i september 2020 de cebuanospråkiga, svenskspråkiga, tyska, franska och nederländska versionerna, ordnade i storlek efter antal riktiga artiklar.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[13] Totalt innehåller Wikipedias olika språkversioner just nu 228 586 156 artiklar, och den svenskspråkiga versionen har 3 431 103 artiklar.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[12][a] Svenskspråkiga Wikipedia innefattar emellertid en stor andel (3,1 miljoner eller 81 procent, noterat januari 2019[14]) robotskapade artiklar och var i september 2020 bara på fjortonde plats sett till antal redigeringar sedan start och på tjugonde plats sett till antal aktiva inloggade bidragsgivare under senaste månaden.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[13] Även cebuanospråkiga Wikipedia innefattar en mycket stor andel (5,3 miljoner eller 99,6 procent) robotskapade artiklar.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[14] De flesta robotskapade artiklar har skapats av svenska Lsjbot, och handlar om djur eller ortnamn.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[15] Många studenter, journalister, författare, forskare, med flera yrkeskategorier, hämtar dagligen uppgifter från Wikipedia, där snabbheten är en stor fördel jämfört med att leta i litteratur och forskningsartiklar.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sökmotorer som Google leder ofta till Wikipedia och driver webbtrafik till Wikipedia.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wikipediaartiklar anses emellertid främst användbara för att hitta andra mer auktoritativa källor snarare än som informationskälla till egna publikationer.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[16] En svensk undersökning visade 2019 att 83 procent av de svenska internetanvändarna använde Wikipedia, varav tio procent gjorde det varje dag.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bland de som studerar använde 94 procent Wikipedia för att söka information.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[17] Samma undersökning visade 2018 att i åldersgruppen upp till 45 år använde 90 procent Wikipedia.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Det var fler män än kvinnor som använde Wikipedia varje vecka: 45 procent män och 33 procent kvinnor.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[18][19] Det finns ämnesorienterade Wikipediasidor som exemplifierar hur Wikipedia kan användas av släktforskare, av lärare och av vandrare.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Det är vanligt förekommande att lärare, i synnerhet på universitetsnivå, avråder studenter från att använda Wikipedia som källa och istället rekommenderar att man går till de mer auktoritativa källor som i sin tur anges i många Wikipediaartiklar, därför att studenten med sitt val av källor ska bevisa uppsatsens akademiska nivå och vetenskapliga aktualitet.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Även Wikipedia rekommenderar att man använder verket för att hitta källor hellre än att uppge Wikipedia som källa.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Andra lärare accepterar enstaka hänvisningar till Wikipedia eller andra uppslagsverk, om andra källor inte kan hittas, under förutsättning att längre uppsatser och examensrapporter inte i sin helhet är baserade på detta, utan grundas på forskningspublikationer, akademiska läroböcker och på studentens egna undersökning.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wikipedia förekommer i princip aldrig i källhänvisningar i forskningspublikationer.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Det förekommer att artiklar på Wikipedia listas bland kurslitteraturen för högskolekurser, bland annat i Sverige 2007, då dock med varnande noter för användning med viss försiktighet.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[20] Forskare kan få fler forskningsciteringar om begrepp som de har myntat och teorier som de har lanserat refereras på Wikipedia, enligt nedan.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wikipediaartiklar har mycket varierande kvalitet.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Wikipediaartiklars trovärdighet vilar mycket på dess källor och på att ett stort antal personer bevakar, granskar och bidrar till artiklarna, medan andra uppslagsverk vilar på att dess författare är experter som anses vara auktoriteter på sina områden.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"En Wikipediaartikels tillförlitlighet kan bedömas bland annat genom att studera artikelns historik, som framgår av forskningsresultat nedan.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"En Wikipediaartikel som stämmer in på följande påståenden har således sannolikt hög trovärdighet: Dessa kriterier gör att den engelska språkversionen av Wikipedia (som har flest skribenter, flest artiklar och i allmänhet längre artiklar förutom om svenska förhållanden) bör ha fler trovärdiga artiklar än den svenska.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Detta är också en vanlig uppfattning bland svenska läsare.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[21] Också vanliga kriterier för källkritik kan tillämpas på Wikipediaartiklar.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Det är tillåtet att direkt kopiera stora delar av artiklarna eller enstaka bilder till en egen publikation, förutsatt att man publicerar den under samma licens som Wikipedia, CC BY-SA (en bild kan ligga under annan öppen licens), och anger källa till artikeln så som licensen kräver.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Publicerar man inte under fri licens krävs att man kommer överens med upphovspersonerna, exempelvis med en fotograf, om ersättning.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Referat av och korta citat från Wikipedia är tillåtna enligt citaträtten som från vilken som helst annan källa.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Eftersom Wikipedia bygger på tidskriftsartiklar, forskningspublikationer och böcker finns risk för rundgång av felaktiga uppgifter, om professionella författare och skribenter slarvar med att uppge källa då de hämtar uppgifter från Wikipedia.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Källhänvisning till Wikipedia måste vara tillräckligt exakt, så att läsare själv kan hitta artikeln och se artikelns författare i artikelhistoriken.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Accessdatum är viktigt, eftersom Wikipediaartiklar förändras.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Källförteckningens källbeskrivning kan exempelvis utformas enligt följande om man använder Harvardsystemet som referenssystem:[22] Vid IEEE- och Vancouversystemet kan källbeskrivning formateras enligt följande (om källan är nummer 2 i källförteckningen): Enligt Oxfordsystemet kan samma källbeskrivning utformas: Alla versioner av sidorna på Wikipedia sparas.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Därmed är det möjligt att länka till just den version av en artikel man använt.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
En länk till arkivversionen tillhandahålls i artiklarnas vänstermarginal.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Den funktionsprincip som ligger till grund för projektet kallas wiki (hawaiiska för snabbt).,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Wikiprincipen avser att det går snabbt att hitta artiklar, att det är enkelt att ändra och länka samman artiklar, att publiceringen inte fördröjs av redaktionell granskning och godkännande samt att det går snabbt att återställa ändringar till en tidigare version av artikeln.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"En wiki är en webbserver och databasserver som möjliggör för ett stort antal människor att tillsammans redigera webbsidor via webbgränssnitt, och innefattar funktioner för artikelhistorik och versionshantering.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
En wiki har således stora likheter med ett webbpubliceringssystem.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Viktiga skillnader är att i en wiki lagras sidorna i en icke-hierarkisk struktur, vilket underlättar sökning och länkning, samt att wikier traditionellt har saknat funktioner för att hantera linjeorganisationens arbetsflöden och beslutsgång för godkännande av publicering.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wikipedia använder sig av den fria wikiprogramvaran MediaWiki som är licensierad under GNU General Public License (GPL).,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Från början använde Wikipedia en annan wikiprogramvara, UseModWiki, som också är licensierad under GPL.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Serverklustren finns (sedan januari 2013) i delstaten Virginia och har även speglade data i casheservrar i datacenter i Amsterdam som bland annat betjänar Europa, i Singapore för Asien samt i San Francisco och Texas för Amerika.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Tillsammans konsumerar de 2 GWh energi per år (år 2016), vilket motsvarar 700 tyska hushålls årsförbrukning.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[23] Wikipedias webbsidor kan delas in i ett antal typer eller namnrymder, där de vanligaste är: För var och en av dessa sidor finns dessutom en diskussionssida, där främst sidans utformning (men inte dess ämne) diskuteras.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Varje sida har en versionshistorik, där man ser vilken användaridentitet som har ändrat vad och när på sidan.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Wikipedias artiklar redigeras vanligen genom att man använder wikikod (wikitext), som är ett kompakt märkspråk.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
För nybörjare och andra som inte vill eller kan använda märkspråk finns sedan sommaren 2013 ett alternativt och enklare redigeringsgränssnitt – VisualEditor.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[24] VisualEditor nås genom att välja fliken Redigera ovanför artikeln, medan wikikoden redigeras genom att välja Redigera wikitext.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Båda metoderna kan användas för att wikifiera artikeln, det vill säga för att infoga länkar till andra artiklar, fotnoter, kategorier, bilder, rubriker, tabeller och annan typografisk formatering.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Wikikod används även för att skapa mallar med innehåll som kan återanvändas i flera olika artiklar, och vars utformning kan anpassas med hjälp av olika parametrar.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Mer komplicerad kodning av artiklar och mallar kan även göras i märkspråken html (för avancerad layout) och TeX (för matematiska formler och notskrift) samt programspråket Lua (för att skapa programmoduler som kan användas i avancerade mallar, och som körs på Mediawikiservern).",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Inloggade användare kan anpassa sitt användargränssnitt genom att välja mellan olika skal (stilmallar), och genom att aktivera olika finesser (program skrivna i språket Javascript).",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Finesser lagras på Mediawikiservern men körs lokalt i användarens webbläsare.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mediawikiprogramvaran är skriven i PHP.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Bilder och andra mediafiler lagras i allmänhet i filarkivet Wikimedia Commons, som är gemensam för alla Wikimedia-projekten, och kan användas också av utomstående.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"En del projekt, såsom finsk- och engelskspråkiga Wikipedia, har dessutom egna filer som inte kan användas i andra projekt; medan innehåll på Commons förutsätts vara fritt, tillåts i dessa projekt även proprietär media på basen av fair use (återgivningsrätt).",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Länkar mellan språkversionerna (språklänkar eller interwikilänkar) lagras sedan 2013 centralt på databasen Wikidata istället för att läggas in med wikikod i varje språkversion av varje artikel.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"På Wikidata kan även siffror, namn och annan kvantitativ data (motsats till löpande text) lagras gemensamt för alla språkversioner.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Data som är gemensamma för många språkversioner behöver på så sätt bara uppdateras på ett ställe.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Data från wikidata länkas automatiskt in i allt fler av Wikipedias faktarutor.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Visionen är att även listor, tabeller, diagram och kartor ska kunna skapas automatiskt för olika språk, något som emellertid kräver komplicerad programmering i sökverktyg som SPARQL(en)[25] och Quarry[26].",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ett enklare alternativ kan vara att lagra en tabelldatafil, exempelvis från ett kalkylark, på en sida i Wikimedia Commons datanamnrymd, vilket underlättar automatiskt skapande av diagram och kartor på olika språk.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[27][28][29] Wikidata är dessutom utformad för att vara en del av den semantiska webben.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Syftet är att underlätta för maskiner (exempelvis kalkylprogram, artificiell intelligens och bottar) att söka, tolka, analysera, visualisera och uppdatera data i Wikidata.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Wikidata lagrar därför data på ett strukturerat sätt, tillsammans med semantisk information som beskriver datats betydelse och relationer (Exempel: Stockholm -> är en instans av -> huvudstad, Stockholm -> tillhör den administrativa enheten -> Stockholms län, Stockholm -> grundades -> 1187).",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[30] Wikipedias ursprungliga användargränssnitt kallas dess stationära vy och är utformat för webbläsare på persondatorer, exempelvis stationära datorer, med relativt stora skärmar.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Idag kan Wikipediasidor även läsas och redigeras från handhållna enheter såsom mobiltelefoner.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Redan 2004 möjliggjorde Wapediatjänsten tillgång från mobiltelefoner via så kallade WAP-sidor (webbliknande teknik avsedd för mobiltelefoner med piltangenter och små skärmar).,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
År 2006[31] och 2007 lanserades mobilanpassade Wikipedia-webbgränssnitt[32] avsedda för mobila plattformar med enkla webbläsare.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"År 2009 öppnades en nyare version som idag är den officiella mobila vyn,[33] avsedd för smartmobiler såsom Symbian-telefoner, iPhone-enheter och Android-enheter.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[34] Engelskspråkiga Wikipedias mobila vy har adressen en.m.wikipedia.org och svenskspråkiga mobila vyn sv.m.wikipedia.org.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Även ett antal mobila appar för ändamålet finns.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Den mobila webbvyn accessas mer ofta än den stationära vyn, för svenskspråkiga Wikipedia sedan slutet av 2015, särskilt under semestermånader, och skillnaden växer.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[35][36] Mobila Wikipediaappar används bara för en bråkdel av accesserna.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[37] Wikipedia är även tillgängligt via spelkonsoler som Playstation 3, Nintendo Wii och Xbox 360.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Där kan man ladda ner databasdumpar av åtminstone engelskspråkiga Wikipedia, men det är då den vanliga webbversionen av uppslagsverket och ingen speciellt utvecklad version.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wikipedia är i regel fritt tillgänglig i alla delar av världen där man har fri tillgång till internet.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Wikipedia censurerar inte sig själv från provocerande eller stötande material, men modereras genom konsensusbeslut baserat på sin egen raderingspolicy.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Dock är stiftelsen Wikimedia Foundation skyldiga att efter en tid radera innehåll som bryter mot amerikansk lag, eftersom servrarna är placerade där, nämligen upphovsrättsbrott, förtal, avslöjande av personuppgifter och brott mot barnskyddslagstiftning.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Till skillnad från nätcommunities som har sina servrar i Sverige är Wikipedia egentligen inte skyldig att följa lagen om elektronisk kommunikation, men dess amerikanska motsvarigheter.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Stiftelsens svenska avdelning arbetar emellertid även med europeisk lagstiftning, exempelvis dataskyddsförordningen[38] Wikipedia påverkas sannolikt inte direkt av upphovsrättsdirektivet.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[39] I likhet med andra sociala medier saknar Wikipedia ansvarig utgivare  och utgivningsbevis i Sverige.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Wikipedias ocensurerade innehåll, och att uppslagsverket inte behöver följa andra länders lagar än USA:s, har anförts som skäl när det blivit utsatt för restriktioner och blockeringar i vissa länder.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Detta har främst skett i länder med internetcensur och inskränkningar i yttrande- och tryckfriheten, på senare tid i Folkrepubliken Kina (""Kinesiska brandväggen"" bland annat sedan 23 april 2019) och Turkiet (från april 2017 till januari 2020 som skylldes på skriverier om Turkiets inblandning i Syriska inbördeskriget[40]).",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I Nordkorea begränsas allmänhetens tillgång till utländska internetsajter.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Tillfällig total blockering av vissa eller alla språkversioner av Wikipedia har skett i Venezuela (i januari 2019), Uzbekistan (2007, 2008, 2012, 2016), Pakistan (2006 och 2010 på grund av hädelse), Syrien (2008–2009), Saudiarabien (2006),[41] och Tunisien (2006).",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Innan 2016 filtrerades vissa Wikipediasidor i Ryssland (om självmord och droger), Saudiarabien[42], Iran och Thailand.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Efter att Wikipedia gick över helt till https-kryptering blev det tekniskt mycket svårt för internetleverantörer att filtrera specifika sidor, och dessa länder hävde då filtreringen.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Krypteringen gör det dessutom mycket svårt att övervaka vem som läser vilken Wikipediaartikel.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Även i länder med hög grad av yttrandefrihet har censur och filtrering skett, såsom i Frankrike (inrikesdepartementets säkerhetstjänst försökte 2013 att censurera en artikel om en militär radiostation[43]) och i Storbritannien (en artikel som innehöll en bild som kategoriserades som barnpornografi av organisationen Internet Watch Foundation blockerades av många internetleverantörer 2008).",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lagförslag i Italien[44] om förhandsgranskning av materialet på Wikipedia ledde till stor uppmärksamhet och förslaget drogs tillbaka.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wikipedia kan redigeras av vem som helst.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Detta gör att encyklopedin är beroende av ett stort antal välmenande skribenter som på frivillig basis håller efter den lilla grupp av skribenter som på olika sätt ställer till problem.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Det sätt genom vilket materialet på Wikipedia skapas leder även till problem då felaktig och vinklad information kan läggas till.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Grundtanken är dock att de flesta användare är intresserade av att bevara och skydda Wikipedia och att dessa därför snabbt kommer att återställa efter klotter och bidrag som inte anses hålla tillräckligt hög standard.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Arbetssättet bygger även på idén att samarbete och diskussion mellan alla användare leder till att gruppen i helhet utvecklas och att konsensus om vad som räknas som neutralt kan uppnås även i svårare frågor.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Grundtankarna går alltså tvärt emot idén om att publiceringen av kunskap bör begränsas till en liten grupp utvalda och speciellt kunniga personer som producerar material i en hierarkisk arbetsdelning.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"En del användare har användarbefogenheter som ger dem tillträde till särskilda verktyg som underlättar arbetet mot klotter, vandalisering och konflikter.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Exempelvis väljs vissa användare till administratörer, som tillfälligt eller tillsvidare kan blockera användare som inte respekterar riktlinjer och konsensusbeslut.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Administratörerna kan också hindra anonyma användare, eller icke-administratörer, från redigering av sidor som ofta är föremål för attacker eller konflikter.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Gemenskapen poängterar att administratörerna inte skall tillmätas större auktoritet i sak, utan endast stödja själva processen.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Flera stora Wikipediaversioner, dock ej den svenska, har infört moderering genom funktionen flagged revisions, alltså att ändringar som görs av nya eller icke inloggade användare inte visas omedelbart för icke inloggade besökare utan fördröjs tills någon tillförlitlig etablerad användare har granskat och godkänt dem.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[45] Innehållet i Wikipedia omfattas av juridiska skäl av lagstiftningen (särskilt lagen om upphovsrätt) i Virginia där Wikipedias servrar[b] numera befinner sig.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Utöver detta är Wikipedias redaktionella principer sammanfattade i de så kallade ""fem pelarna"", och många policyer och riktlinjer syftar till att utforma innehållet på lämpligt sätt.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Även dessa regler finns lagrade i wiki-form, och Wikipedia-skribenter kan skriva och revidera dessa policyer och riktlinjer.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[47] Dessa riktlinjer och policyer tillämpas genom att Wikipedia-skribenterna kan ta bort, märka eller ändra artikelmaterial som inte uppfyller dem.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
De regler som de icke-engelska utgåvorna av Wikipedia har baseras ofta på en översättning av reglerna på den engelskspråkiga Wikipedia och skrivs i Sverige utifrån lokala svenskspråkiga diskussioner.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wikipedia är också en internetgemenskap.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Som sådan har den utvecklat en egen kultur och egna traditioner, och de sammanfattas i fem grundprinciper: De olika språkversionerna av Wikipedia fungerar som stora internetbaserade grupparbeten, med målet att skapa en encyklopedi.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Kontakter och diskussioner mellan medlemmarna i grupparbetet sker i regel i samma gränssnitt, via artiklarnas eller användarnas diskussionssidor eller genom de olika deltagarportalerna.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Förutom samarbetet och diskussioner online, arrangeras olika sorters fysiska träffar mellan Wikipediaanvändare.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I USA finns exempelvis Great American Wiknic, en årlig Wikipediaträff som under sommaren anordnas i flera amerikanska städer.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[48] Ibland samlas Wikipediaanvändare lokalt till olika specialevenemang med syftet att bidra till projektet, exempelvis genom att ägna en dag åt fotografering av ett område (""fotosafari"") eller för att redigera tillsammans på en skrivstuga.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Skrivstugor har ofta specifika teman, där Wikipediaartiklar om kvinnor är ett särskilt vanligt tema.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lokalt anordnas ofta mindre och informella träffar på exempelvis något café eller pub.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
På svenskspråkiga Wikipedia kallas dessa möten Wikifika eller Wikipub.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Wikipedias trovärdighet, både jämfört med andra uppslagsverk och andra specialiserade källor, kan analyseras på olika sätt, bland annat genom blindtester av experter, genom statistik, genom analys av historiska mönster och genom att analysera styrkor och svagheter i wikimodellen.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"På Wikipedia finns ingen redaktion utan allt arbete utförs av mestadels anonyma frivilliga, vilket kan förväntas påverka tillförlitligheten negativt.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Å andra sidan finns det fler som kan rätta felen.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
År 2014 mätte forskare vid Harvard Business School hur politiskt vinklat språket är (andelen ideologiskt laddade formuleringar) i 70 000 engelskspråkiga Wikipediaartiklar om politik.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"De mätte också artiklarnas neutralitet i form av balansen mellan antal formuleringar som är vanliga bland USA:s demokrater (exempelvis “poor people”, “tax breaks” och “change the rules”) respektive konservativa (“illegal aliens”, “death tax” och “border security”).",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"De utvärderade även motsvarande artiklar i det traditionella uppslagsverket Encyclopedia Britannica, i syfte att jämföra neutraliteten av kollektivt författad information med expertgenererat material.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[49] Artikelhistoriken visade att Wikipediaartiklar i ett tidigt skede ofta har ett vinklat språk, och kan växla mellan i huvudsak vänster- och högervinkling under tidens gång, men de artiklar som har redigerats flest gånger (tusentals gånger) har försumbara skillnader i vinkling och neutralitet jämfört med Encyclopedia Britannicas motsvarande artiklar, och är dessutom mer fördjupade.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bidragsgivare till Wikipedias politikartiklar som har formulerat sig radikalt tenderar att förändra sitt sätt att skriva så att deras bidrag efter några år innehåller märkbart färre ideologiskt laddade formuleringar.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Emellertid är antal redigeringar av en Wikipediaartikel endast svagt korrelerat med antal läsare av artikeln – många populära artiklar är nya och har omarbetats få gånger.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Detta gör att ur läsarens synvinkel är fortfarande engelskspråkiga Wikipedias politikartiklar mer vinklade än Encyclopedia Britannicas artiklar, något oftare mot vänster än höger, men att balansen är olika för olika ämnesområden.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[49] Wikipedia bedöms dock vara betydligt mer neutral än kollektivt och användargenererat material i allmänhet på Internet (bloggar, sociala nätverk, diskussionsforum, kommentarsfält och andra wikier), sannolikt därför att de senare skrivs av mindre communities än Wikipedia och har färre innehållsstyrande policyer.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Därför är dessa avsevärt mer känsliga för starka uppfattningar och kontroversiella påståenden som framförs av dominerande bidragsgivare.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[49] Wikipedias diskussionsforum karaktäriseras, trots redigeringskrig och kritik för pedanteri och sexism, tvärtom av sansade diskussioner mellan meningsmotståndare som hittar gemensam konsensus, och även vid djupt kontroversiella ämnen.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Med hänvisning till denna forskning har debattörer därför beskrivit Wikipedia som en möjlig lösning på internets största problem med osaklig polarisering och desinformation.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[50] Då Wikipedia är öppet för gemensam redigering och kan redigeras anonymt bedöms Wikipedias trovärdighet ofta efter hur fort felaktig eller missvisande information som avsiktligen har lagts in raderas.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"På engelskspråkiga Wikipedia gjordes en undersökning 2007 som visade att ca fem procent av det som skrivs på Wikipedia är klotter men att det har tagits bort inom en mediantid på 14 minuter, men i enstaka fall kan ligga kvar i flera år utan att upptäckas.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Risken att den artikelversion man läser innehåller klotter beräknades till cirka 0,004 procent.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[51] En undersökning som publicerades 2005 i tidskriften Nature visar att när det gäller artiklar om vetenskapliga ämnen var engelskspråkiga Wikipedia nästan lika korrekt som Encyclopædia Britannica.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wikipedia hade också ungefär samma antal allvarliga fel i artiklarna.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[52][53] Uppgifterna har ifrågasatts av Encyclopædia Britannica.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[54] I en jämförelse utförd av Svenska Dagbladet 2006 där nio experter granskade varsin av nio artiklar mellan Nationalencyklopedin och svenskspråkiga Wikipedia var Nationalencyklopedin bäst i sex fall och Wikipedia var bäst i tre fall.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[55] Statens medieråd skrev (i en icke daterad artikel tillgänglig 2015) att ""De stickprov som gjorts visar dock på små skillnader.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Där NE vinner i tillförlitlighet vinner Wikipedia i aktualitet.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Man ska dock tänka på att vissa texter på Wikipedia bara är påbörjade medan andra kan vara betydligt mer utvecklade än innehållet i NE.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""[56] Ungefär ett år senare togs formuleringen om tillförlitlighet och aktualitet bort i en senare version av artikeln.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[57] Den 24 oktober 2005 publicerade brittiska The Guardian en artikel med titeln ”Can you trust Wikipedia?” ('Kan man lita på Wikipedia?'),Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
där en panel av experter ombads granska sju artiklar som berörde deras specialområden och betygsätta artiklarna med 0-10 poäng.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Alla artiklarna fick mellan 0 och 8 poäng, men de flesta fick mellan 5 och 8 poäng.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[58] Den vanligaste kritiken var: Det vanligaste berömmet var: Kritik och skepsis mot Wikipedia har funnits sedan start, och var särskilt framträdande när allmänheten först började upptäcka fenomenet och olika incidenter inträffade första gången.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Eftersom engelskspråkiga Wikipedia är den största språkupplagan tar mycket av kritiken sina exempel därifrån.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Till de skarpaste kritikerna hör ofta personer vars bidrag till Wikipedia har raderats.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wikipedia får kritik för att artiklarnas tillförlitlighet är blandad och för att vissa artiklar är mycket korta eller har knapphändigt med källhänvisningar.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Wikipedia får kritik för att författarna i hög grad är västerländska män, ofta med akademisk bakgrund, och att balansen mellan artikelämnen och perspektiv kan påverkas av dessa författares intresseområden.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wikipedias öppenhet gör den mottaglig även för redigeringar som inte är välmenade.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Eftersom öppna nätverk fortfarande är en ny företeelse för de flesta, är många besökares första redigering rent klotter - de testar om ""Redigera den här sidan"" verkligen är det den ger sig ut för att vara.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Många användare upptäckte Wikipedia på liknande sätt och eftersom klotter är lätt att ta bort är toleransen också ganska hög gentemot företeelsen.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Det tar inte lång tid innan uppenbart klotter är borttaget.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Däremot tolereras inte avsiktlig vandalism.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Användare som kontinuerligt förstör artiklar kan utestängas från framtida deltagande i projektet genom att en administratör blockerar deras användarkonto eller IP-adress.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"En tidig studie gjord av IBM 2003 visade att vandalism i genomsnitt tas bort mycket snabbt, men i enstaka fall kan ligga kvar mycket länge.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[59] En annan tidig studie (från 2007) som mätte sidvisningar på engelskspråkiga Wikipedia med felaktigt vandaliserat innehåll kom fram till att 42 procent av allt klotter eller vandalism återställdes innan det hunnit ses av icke inloggade användare.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[60] Ett annat beteende som ofta ses som ett problem är bidragsgivare som använder flera användarnamn utöver sitt egentliga i vilseledande syfte.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dessa kallas sock puppets eller marionetter.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Grundaren Larry Sanger övergav tidigt projektet, och har sedan dess varit en av dess kritiker.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Han menade våren 2020 att Wikipedia allvarligt lider av bristande neutralitet därför att man enligt honom har övergett principen om att återge många perspektiv och att inte ta ställning.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Engelskspråkiga Wikipedia har istället börjat tillämpa en princip om att undvika falsk balans, och tar därför ställning för etablerade vetenskapliga uppfattningar.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Enligt Sanger främställs därför minoritetsuppfattningar bland forskare ibland som pseudovetenskap.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Sanger ger även exempel på icke-vetenskaplig religionskritik som har fått utrymme, och på att Wikipedia enligt honom ger vänsterpolitisk kritik större utrymme än högerperspektiv.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[61] Wikipedia har anklagats för att ha en tendens att täcka vissa ämnen oproportionerligt i förhållande till hur viktigt ämnet är.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I en intervju med The Guardian[62] 2004 sade Dale Hoiberg, Encyclopædia Britannicas chefredaktör, om engelskspråkiga Wikipedia: Intervjun publicerades 26 oktober 2004.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"28 mars 2005 hade artikeln om kinesisk konst blivit tre gånger så stor som den om orkanen Frances, underartiklar ej inräknade, och artikeln om Tony Blair var 50 % större än den om Coronation Street.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Wikipedias förespråkare pekar på sådana exempel för att visa att vinklingarna kommer att bli mindre med tiden, medan motståndare anser att just dessa artiklar fick extra uppmärksamhet på grund av intervjun, och att ökningen inte gäller alla artiklar.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[källa behövs] År 2006 listade hemsidan wikipedia-watch.org ett dussintal plagieringar gjorda av redaktörer på den engelska versionen av Wikipedia.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Jimmy Wales som varit med och grundat Wikipedia sade i detta sammanhang: ""Vi måste hantera sådana händelser på fullaste allvar, utan nåd, eftersom denna typ av plagiering strider till 100 % mot alla våra grundläggande principer.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[63] Wikipedia har kritiserats, bland annat av Larry Sanger 2012, för att tillåta sexuellt innehåll i sina artiklar, bland annat bilder och filmer av onani och ejakulation samt även foton från pornografiska filmer i flera artiklar.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[64] Kritikerna menade att sexuellt innehåll visas för frikostigt på Wikipedia och att bilderna är för lättåtkomliga för barn som eventuellt använder Wikipedia i sitt skolarbete.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[64][65] Exempelvis visas det kontroversiella originalomslaget till albumet Virgin Killer av bandet Scorpions på engelska Wikipedia.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Omslaget föreställer en naken minderårig flicka.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2008 blockerades artikeln under fyra dagar av de flesta av Storbritanniens internetleverantörer.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[66] Detta efter att den rapporterats som barnpornografi av ”The Internet Watch Foundation”, en ideell organisation som letar efter olagligt innehåll på Internet och samarbetar med bland annat brittisk polis.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
De ansåg då att införandet av bilden i artikeln var ”smaklöst”.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[67] Efter att Wikipedias grundare Larry Sanger pekat ut vad han ansåg vara fall av barnpornografi i Wikipedias bildbank Wikimedia Commons, tog Wikipedias andra grundare Jimmy Wales hastigt bort flera bilder med sexuellt innehåll, inklusive sakligt material, utan att konsultera användarna i stort.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Detta har han fått kritik för och har nu frivilligt gett upp en del av de privilegier han haft som grundare.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[68] Under 2007 utvecklade CalTech-studenten Virgil Griffith webbtjänsten ""WikiScanner"" som samkör flera register.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Därigenom upptäcktes det att olika organisationer, till exempel CIA, Vatikanen och Astra Zeneca redigerat vinklat i artiklar som rörde deras respektive områden.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Generellt betraktades företagens beteende som dåligt, medan Wikiscanner spåddes få stor betydelse för att övervaka kvaliteten på Wikipedia.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[69] WikiScanning-historien uppmärksammades av The Independent, som fastslog att många censureringar, som gjorts på en rad Wikipediaartiklar av användare med egenintresse, hade upptäckts: Wikipedia har kritiserats för att ha löst definierade krav på vilka ämnen som anses vara tillräckligt kända att det är relevanta för uppslagsverket och kan få egna artiklar utan att raderas.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Författaren Nicholson Baker skrev i The New York Review of Books att diskussionen kring vad som är relevant är så kontroversiell att ingen kan bilda sig en klar uppfattning och hävdade att artiklar om ämnen som borde vara relevanta lätt raderas.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[70] Wikipedia har kritiserats för att en liten grupp människor står för den största delen av innehållet.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[71] Mätningar av Wikipedias neutralitet visar att det kan krävas ett mycket stort antal bidrag (ofta tusentals) för att en Wikipediaartikel ska uppnå kvalitet som är jämförbar med en expertförfattad uppslagsverksartikel.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Det kollaborativa skrivandet är därmed ineffektivt, och gör att nyskapade artiklar och artiklar som inte har många bidragsgivare kan ha stora brister.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[49] Auktoritetsbristen och avsaknad av expertgranskning innebär att en kvalitetssäkring saknas av artiklarnas lägstanivå.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
När nya bidrag görs till Wikipedia handlar det ofta om små delar eller delar av en sida som ej utsätts för granskning.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hög- och lågkvalitetsändringar kan då blanda sig i samma artikel.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Till exempel sa historikern Roy Rosenzweig: ""Rent generellt är själva skrivandet Wikipedias akilleshäl.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Grupper skriver sällan bra och bidragen på Wikipedia är ofta av ojämn kvalitet som beror på att meningar och stycken skrivna av olika personer har sammanfogats.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""[72] Även om en artikel är faktamässigt korrekt kan den lida av andra kvalitestsbrister, exempelvis att språket har bristande läsbarhet, ibland så att det ser ut som att den har maskinöversatts flera gånger.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[73]  Orsaken kan vara att olika delar har redigerats av olika bidragsgivare med olika grad av språkliga färdigheter och olika syn på hur tekniskt detaljerat språket ska vara.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I mindre språkversioner av Wikipedia kan bristerna bero på att mycket av innehållet kommer från översättningar av gamla versioner av Wikipediaartiklar på andra språk, och från nationell nyhetsmedia, i stället för från aktuella auktoritativa källor.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Översättningen kan vara bristfällig och kvalitetsbrister kan ligga kvar länge om få kontrollerar artikeln.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Bibliotekarien Philip Bradley säger i en intervju med The Guardian i oktober 2004 att ""Det huvudsakliga problemet är bristen på auktoritet.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Med tryckta publikationer måste utgivaren se till att den information denne publicerar är sanningsenlig då deras levebröd hänger på det.""",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[62][74] Encyclopædia Britannicas före detta chefredaktör Robert McHenry och Paul Vallely har även de noterat att Wikipedias läsare inte kan veta vem som skrivit artikeln de läser - den kan vara skriven av någon som inte är en expert på ämnet.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"McHenry har också framfört att Wikipedia faller på att den säger sig vara en encyklopedi, ett ord som inger en auktoritet och pålitlighet som är oförenligt med koncepten öppenhet och wiki.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[75][76] Larry Sanger, Nupedias förre chefredaktör, har i en intervju med Kuro5hin sagt att ett av Wikipedias stora problem är den ""anti-elitism"" som finns.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wikipedia ber användarna att verifiera innehållet genom att uppge och kontrollera källor.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Dessa kan i praktiken vara bloggar, och ibland kan det visa sig att en artikel på Wikipedia verifieras genom att innehållet kontrolleras mot en källa, som i sin tur har använt Wikipedia som källa utan att uppge detta.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I en magisteruppsats har det visat sig att över 90 procent av de gymnasieelever som ingick i undersökningsgruppen ser förekomsten av källor som det främsta kriteriet i bedömningen av en artikels tillförlitlighet.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ett betydligt mindre antal elever, bara två procent, tycker att författaren till artikeln är viktig.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[77] Detta skiljer sig därför markant från andra uppslagsverk, där till exempel en aktad författare eller forskare kan anses som en trovärdig källa.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I ""Cult of the Amateur – How Today’s Internet is Killing Our Culture and Assaulting Our Economy"",[78] berättar IT-entreprenören Andrew Keen om sitt missnöje med Wikipedia.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Han menar att de amatörer som skriver på sidan växer på bekostnad av forskare och experter.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Detta bidrar till en disharmoni när webben utvecklas och författaren får ett samspel med publiken.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Gränsen mellan amatör och expert suddas ut då amatörernas bloggar eller redigeringar inte alltid är kvalitetssäkrade, utan helt enkelt det som blir det mest intressanta och som då hörs mest.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Han menar dock inte att det är den öppna tekniken, där alla är välkomna som användare som är problemet, utan själva implementeringen - det krävs en balansgång mellan öppenheten och auktoriteten.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[79] Under åren har det inletts flera projekt för att få forskare att hjälpa till att stärka kvaliteten i Wikipedias artiklar.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[80] Wikipedias regler tillåter inte  originalforskning och att nya begrepp myntas där, utan de måste första ha publicerats, men nya begrepp kan få större spridning om de nämns på Wikipedia, och forskaren som har myntat begreppet kan därmed bli citerad mer ofta i studentuppsatser och vetenskapliga publikationer.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Undersökningar (bland annat 2017[81]) har visat att ord som presenterats i Wikipedia-artiklar senare ofta kan dyka upp i akademiska uppsatser.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[82][83][84] Den akademiska tidskriften RNA Biology började 2008 koppla samman artikelskrivandet i tidskriften och dess relaterade databas med skrivandet på Wikipedia.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[85] I bokkapitlet ""Wikipedianer: om Wikipedia i undervisningen"" i antologin ""Pedagogiskt arbete i teori och praktik: om bibliotekariens roll för studenters och doktoranders lärande"" (red.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Birgitta Hansson & Anna Lyngfelt) skriver högskolebibliotekarien Jan Hjalmarsson om hur Wikipedia kan användas i högre utbildning för att träna studenterna i att jämföra källor, diskutera och problematisera olika typer av digitala källor.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Han beskriver hur han har arbetat med Wikipedia i undervisningen inom etnologiämnet på Södertörns högskola, och hur studenterna fick en uppgift som innebar att skulle skriva/redigera artiklar på Wikipedia om olika för etnologiämnet relevanta vetenskapliga begrepp som t.ex.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"subkultur, motkultur, genus och intersektionalitet.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[86] Ett annat exempel på hur studenterna kan arbeta med Wikipedia inom ramen för sina högskolestudier beskrivs i artikeln ""Bildning för vår tids bibliotek"" skriven av Karin Grönvall och Jan Hjalmarsson där de lyfter fram ett samarbete med ämnet marinarkeologi på Södertörns högskola.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[87] Den globala enkätundersökningen Wikimedia General User Survey 2009[88] genomfördes under hösten 2008 bland besökare av 21 språkversioner av Wikipedia, främst den engelska, tyska och spanska versionen, dock ej den svenska versionen.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Deltagarna i enkäten var boende i 228 olika länder.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1,14% var från Sverige.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Av enkätsvaren var 35% Wikipediaförfattare (i huvudsak icke regelbundna bidragsgivare), medan 65% läste Wikipedia utan att bidra.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"0,98% var dessutom administratörer.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"12,8% av författarna och 31,2% av läsarna var kvinnor.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Deltagarna var i åldrarna 10 - 85 år.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Medelåldern bland författarna var 26,8 år, och bland läsarna 25,3 år.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Gällande högsta examen som Wikipediaförfattarna hade uppnått hade 4,6% doktorerat, 15,1% hade högst uppnått masters/magisterexamen, 28,4% högst kandidatexamen, 33,4% endast gymnasieexamen, och 12,4% endast grundskoleexamen.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Enligt en artikel i DN är bara drygt 10 procent av de som bidrar till Wikipedia kvinnor.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[89][90] I en studie bland internetanvändare som genomfördes under 2007 av Hitwise (australiskt marknadsundersökningsföretag) och som även återgavs i tidningen Time,[91] fann man att Wikipedias besökare var nästan jämnt fördelade mellan män och kvinnor men att 60% av alla redigeringar gjordes av män.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2018 rapporterade The Guardian att studier visar att endast 16% av redigerare på Wikipedia är kvinnor.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[92] I konferensartikeln ""Talk before you Type: Coordination in Wikipedia""[93] har artiklarnas diskussionssidor undersökts.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Författarna har klassificerat sidorna i elva olika kategorier: koordinering av redigering, fakta som saknas, klotter, policy och riktlinjer, länkar till interna Wikipediaresurser (andra diskussionssidor), ""off topic"", omröstningar, granskning för artikelrekommendation, ""infobox"", bilder och övrigt.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Författarna menar att en del strategisk planering av artikelredigering sker genom diskussionssidorna.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I en tidigare artikel hade samma författare presenterat diskussionssidorna som en arena enbart för konfliktlösning.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Författarna hävdar också att samtalet i diskussionssidorna är formaliserat (vissa etikettregler finns, som att signera sina inlägg) och policydrivet (referenser till riktlinjerna förekommer ofta).",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"En beskrivande studie[94] som analyserade engelskspråkiga Wikipedias policyer och riktlinjer fram till september 2007 identifierade en del intresseväckande statistik: Även om grundprincipen ""Strunta i reglerna"" (ignore-all-rules) endast är sexton ord lång på engelskspråkiga Wikipedia så är sidan som förklarar policyn över femhundra ord lång.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Den hänvisar läsarna till sju andra dokument, den har genererat över 8 000 ord av diskussion och har redigerats över 100 gånger under mindre än ett år.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Studien jämförde även utvecklingen av policyer i form av tillförda ord jämfört med när de först skrevs: Siffran för ""deletion"" ansågs ej vara rättvis och heltäckande då policyn har delats upp i flera underpolicyer.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wikipedia gör det möjligt att redigera anonymt.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"De som redigerar måste inte uppge sin identitet, eller ens en e-postadress.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"En studie från 2007 vid Dartmouth College av franskspråkiga och nederländska Wikipedia, pekar på att i motsats till det förväntade sociala mönstret, var de som redigerade anonymt några av de mest produktiva bidragsgivarna av innehåll med hög klass.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[förtydliga] Förklaringen till detta[förtydliga] skulle enligt forskarna ligga i att förutsättningarna för att producera det som man kan kalla för ”allmän egendom” (collective goods) är så annorlunda vad gäller Wikipedia, jämfört med andra sammanhang.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Det anses allmänt bland sociologer att det behövs en kritisk massa när en heterogen grupp med individer med både olika förutsättningar och motivation ska komma igång med att producera ”allmän egendom”.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Denna uppnås med det produktionssätt som till exempel Wikipedia har på ett enklare och snabbare sätt än annars.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Det blir fler som deltar och kvalitén ökar.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Med andra ord gör tekniken det möjligt att nå tidigare outnyttjade ""resurser"", genom att tröskeln för att delta sänkts.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Forskarna valde 1 000 bidrag av registrerade användare och 1 000 bidrag av icke registrerade användare slumpmässigt ur vardera språkgrupp (av totalt mer än 87 000 bidrag den 1 mars 2005).,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[95][förtydliga] I en studie [96] utförd av forskare från University of Washington och HP Labs har man försökt analysera redigeringskrig och konflikter i engelskspråkiga Wikipedias datadump från 2006: Wikipedia är ett massornas samarbete där formuleringen av artiklar inte bestäms definitivt utan genom konsensus.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
De sociala relationerna mellan Wikipedianerna leder ibland till konflikter.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Policyer (""policies"") och riktlinjer (""guidelines"") underlättar ofta konfliktlösning men forskarna har hittat flera exempel där fundamentalt olika tolkningar av policyer inte har lett till någon lösning utan tvärtom förhindrat konsensus.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Författarna har valt att analysera engelskspråkiga Wikipedias datadump från 2006.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I denna dump har man försökt hitta redigeringskrig genom att studera artiklar med minst 250 redigeringar på dess diskussionssidor.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Detta motsvarade 0,3 % av alla diskussionssidor.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Dessa utvalda diskussionssidor täckte in 28,4 % av alla redigeringar på diskussionssidorna i dumpen.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Dessutom täcker detta urval in 51,1 % av alla länkar till policyer.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sedan har man från de utvalda diskussionssidorna riktat in sig på kritiska sektioner genom att välja redigeringar under en tidsperiod då det var både många redigeringar på artikelsidan såväl som på diskussionssidan.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Man hittade att tillit till konsensus ofta leder till ett antal tillfälliga maktspel.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Maktspel som uppträdde ofta handlade om: Konsensus är aldrig slutgiltig och i dispyter diskuteras ofta legitimiteten i tidigare konsensus.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Veteraner vill inte slösa tid på frågor som de anser lösta medan nybörjare uppfattar att deras perspektiv inte representerats i tidigare argument och därför vill lyfta konsensus till diskussion igen.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Artikelförfattarna menar att Wikipedias nätgemenskap främjas av det svåra arbetet att söka konsensus och att sådant arbete kanske är det största formuleringsarbetet i Wikipedia och motsätter sig andra forskares åsikt att dessa aspekter av samarbetet är ""kostsamt"" och ""improduktivt"".",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Man erkänner dock att en del koordinationsarbete kan vara överflödigt men att eventuella verktyg för att underlätta koordinering inte får förstöra den sammanhållande funktion som konsensussökande diskussioner också skapar.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Med koordinationsarbete menar man mödan att beskriva och arkivera tidigare diskussioner samt att hitta bland arkiverade diskussioner.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Det man efterfrågar är bland annat visualiseringsverktyg för att annotera tidigare konsensus och vilka som var med i denna process, för att sammanfatta konflikter över tid så att man lättare kan förstå en artikels tillstånd.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ett meritsystemverktyg skulle kunna motivera till meningsfulla redigeringar, men kan även ge upphov till konkurrens.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ett innehållsdrivet meritsystem riskerar att bidragsgivare av rädsla för att sänka sin meritstatus försöker förhindra att deras text ändras.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Forskare vid Carnegie Mellon University har utifrån en mängd statistik försökt skapa en modell
[97] för att förstå och förutsäga administratörsval på engelskspråkiga Wikipedia.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I modellen har de tagit in flera faktorer som i olika utsträckning påverkade resultatet av valet.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Bland annat kunde de visa att antalet artikelredigeringar påverkade väldigt lite, men att policy- och projektredigeringar höjde chanserna från 1,8 % till 17-19 % per 1 000 redigeringar.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"De visade även att aktivitet i inom olika områden och att skriva redigeringssammanfattningar ökade chanserna att bli vald, medan medverkan i medlingsärenden över lag sänkte chanserna.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Modellen använde dock rätt trubbiga mått på aktiviteten och forskarna konstaterar att man bör analysera vad administratörerna gör mer exakt.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Forskarna påpekar själva att modellen inte tar vara på kvalitén i redigeringarna utan bara utgår från kvantiteten, men den har ändå visat sig kunna förutsäga 74,8 % av valresultaten.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Några exempel på faktorer: (Värden inom parentes är inte statistiskt säkerställda) I studien The Work of Sustaining Order in Wikipedia: The Banning of a Vandal[98] undersöks hur automatiserade och halvautomatiserade verktyg i kombination med samarbete bekämpar vandalism.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

tidigare undersökningar som visar att en relativt liten grupp användare står för en stor del av redigeringarna och för en stor del av det material som blir kvar i artiklarna.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Författarna visar att dessa användare går att känna igen från deras första tid på Wikipedia, bland annat genom att de gör flera redigeringar per dag.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Dessa användare hänvisar också ofta till Wikipediaprojektets normer, såsom att skriva från en neutral utgångspunkt.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

träsk är en bit våtmark och om någon trampar på fel ställe i ett träsk kan de lätt drunkna och verbets form av träsk betyder att sjunka så här kan du använda detta ord.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
låt oss säga att du har många uppdrag och att du har ett test som kommer och dina vänner kommer till dig och de säger.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hej varför hänger du inte med oss?,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Du kan säga till dem jag är så ledsen men jag är överbelastad med arbete eller jag har överraskat några andra ord som du kan använda i stället för översvämmad är jag har för mycket att göra.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
det finns för mycket på min tallrik som jag drunknar i jobbet.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
jag är deluged med uppdrag smart ord nummer två är catch-22 nu är jag säker på att du ' Jag har hört detta ord innan catch-22 betyder en omöjlig situation där du inte kan göra en sak om du inte har gjort den andra och du inte kan göra den andra eftersom du inte har gjort den första har.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Jag förvirrade dig, så låt mig ge dig några exempel, en situation med fångst-22 är när du inte får jobb utan att ha arbetslivserfarenhet.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
men du kan inte få erfarenhet förrän du får jobb catch-22 myntades av joseph heller i hans berömda bok med samma namn catch-22 när han beskrev några motstridiga regler som var tillämpliga på soldater under andra världskriget.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ett annat exempel på catch-22 är att du behöver ett banklån eftersom du inte har tillräckligt.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pengar men du skulle inte få det banklånet om du inte bevisar för banken att du har tillräckligt med pengar så nästa gång du fastnar i en knepig situation kom ihåg.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
att använda ordet catch-22.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
och få dessa beundrande utseende från dina vänner andra ord som du kan använda i stället för fångst-22 är paradoxa eller dilemma smarta ord.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nummer tre är suave suave suave betyder att vara sofistikerad för att vara artig och cool och.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
välmodig ordet suave har flera olika ursprung men ett mycket intressant ursprung till ordet är vilket betyder trevlig eller söt smakprov.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
han är så redo och suave speciellt framför damerna eller barack obama är så suave och polerad nu kom ihåg när du är på en fest nästa gång och du ser den här personen som är så.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
väluppfostrad och kultiverad och sofistikerad.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
glöm inte att säga hej vem som är den suave killen där ute i hörnet med hjälp av detta ord kommer omedelbart att göra ditt ordförråd.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
väldigt suave så smart ord nummer fyra är grymt grymt ordet grymt betyder något riktigt dåligt hemskt grymt fruktansvärt fruktansvärt grymt grymt har en latinsk rot som heter .som betyder rädsla grymt eller hemskt några exempel på ordet grymt är de senaste våldtäktsincidenterna i Delhi var grymma eller fångar behandlas.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
på ett grymt sätt ibland i fängelser används också grymma i det dagliga livet för att prata om något vanligt felaktigt görande och du vill överdriva det.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
till exempel hans bordssätt var grymt eller hennes klädkänsla är så grymt eller hans grammatik är grymt.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
så nästa gång du hör av en hemsk handling i nyheterna kom ihåg att.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"kommentera och säg att detta är en grym handling smart ord nummer 5 är häpnadsväckande, häpnadsväckande, häpnadsväckande, betyder fantastiskt häpnadsväckande.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nu använder vi ofta ordet häftigt här ' s ett annat ord som du kan använda istället för häpnadsväckande häpnadsväckande till exempel idag fick jag en häpnadsväckande poäng på mitt test vilket innebär att jag fick en mycket hög poäng eller.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
jag fick en nästan perfekt poäng ordet häpnadsväckande har klassiska latinska rötter från ordet som betyder.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
att bli bedövad så häpnadsväckande används för att beskriva något som är fantastiskt bra till exempel ser hon häpnadsväckande ut i den klänningen eller vilken underbar utsikt från den här balkongen eller jag läser den här fantastiska boken som jag inte kan lägga ner vad sägs om att du går och säga.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dina vänner som är denna fantastiska kanal för studenter och några andra ord som du kan använda istället för fantastiska är otroligt fantastiska eller exceptionellt bra ok så innan vi fortsätter med de balanserade fem orden på den här videon kom ihåg att lägga en kommentar under den här videon.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
att berätta vilken av dessa tio ord som var ditt favorit smarta ord nummer sex är i en fix i en fix betyder att vara i en besvärlig situation till exempel pojke jag är i en fix eftersom jag har planerat med två olika vänner för detta kväll.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jag har tappat min telefon och jag är i en fix eller vår buss gick sönder i morse och jag är i en fix som min vän alltid vänder sig till mig för hjälp när han är i fix och när det går bra han glömmer bort.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mig så nästa gång du får matta läxor från skolan till exempel och om du har lämnat din mattebok i skolan så kan du berätta för dina vänner att du är i en riktig fix nu kanske du tror att ordet fix har något att göra med att reparera något.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
men nej i en fix betyder att vara i en besvärlig situation andra ord som du kan använda istället för i en fix är att jag är i en soppa eller i ' m i en röra eller jag är i en plåga eller bara jag är i en plats smart ord nummer 7 är flummox flummox betyder att förvirra någon.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
så mycket att de glömmer vad de ska göra nu förvirrade tenderar att vara ett överanvändt ord så istället för det varför använder du inte flummox till exempel såg pojken helt ut .flummoxed när läraren ställde honom en fråga i klassen eller hunden var flummoxed ut vid sin egen reflektion i spegeln eller turisten blev uppslukad av de olika sederna som.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
han stötte på under sina resor eller i en intervju när hon frågades varför ska vi anställa dig såg hon ut helt flummoxed så nästa gång om du blir förvirrad på några frågor till exempel vid en undersökning så du.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
kan alltid säga det eftersom jag inte hade ' Jag förberedde mig väldigt bra för provet.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jag blev förvirrad av några av de frågor som andra ord som du kan använda istället för flummoxade är förvirrade förbryllade eller förvirrade smarta ord nummer åtta är möte rendezvous rendezvous.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
är ett mycket franskt sätt att säga möte eller datum till exempel jag har ett möte med mina vänner över lunch på lördag eller jag planerar att möta mina vänner på köpcentret för filmer möte kan användas både som substantiv eller som verb till exempel.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jag har ett möte med mina vänner i kväll eller jag ska möta mina vänner imorgon.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i frankrike användes tidigare möte av armén för att ange en mötesplats för trupperna nu finns det något lite spännande och hemlighetsfullt om ordet möte även nu så medan du kan använda möte för alla möten.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"i allmänhet men det vann ' t är väldigt lämpligt för ett officiellt möte, så om du har ett datum kanske du säkert kan ringa att ett möte smart ord nummer 9 är tråkigt tråkigt tråkigt är en förolämpning du skulle använda det när du försöker kalla någon dum eller ointelligent.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
eller svag nu har du hört ordet tråkigt i geometri trubbig vinkel och spetsig vinkel så att en tråkig vinkel är en vinkel större än 90 grader men mindre än 180 grader.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
och en skarp vinkel är denna skarpa vinkel mindre än 90 grader så skarp som ett ord används för att beteckna skarpt och därför också mentalt skarpt och stumt betecknar trubbigt och.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
därför också lite långsamt i sinnet så exempel meningar med stum är mannen var så trubbig att han gav bort sitt lösenord till en falsk uppringare eller det tråkiga barnet.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
kunde inte.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
att svara på en enda fråga på testet eller den tråkiga mannen hade svårt att förstå även grundläggande instruktioner nu antar att i din situation i det dagliga livet är din pojkvän eller din flickvän arg på dig och du vet inte varför så du kan. säg till dem kanske jag är tråkig men jag vet inte varför du är så upprörd smart ord nummer 10 är trög trög trög betyder att röra sig långsamt för att vara lite långsammare.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
än vanligt att se lite trött och saknas.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i energi exempel en tung lunch gör mig mycket på eftermiddagen trög har rötter från ordet som betyder en långsam person och en snigel är ett djur som rör sig riktigt mycket långsamt som en snigel exempel.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ekonomin har varit mycket trög i år eller matchen tog fart efter en trög start.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
eller när affärer har varit tröga i det här kvartalet kan du använda det i ditt dagliga liv om du känner dig väldigt trött en dag kan du berätta för din mamma eller berätta.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dina vänner jag känner mig mycket trög.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
idag kunde jag göra med en energidryck andra ord som du kan använda i stället för trög kan vara slö eller dra i fötterna så det var de 10 smarta orden och tidigare.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

lyckligt lärande och jag ses snart i en annan lektion.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
det gyllene brödet en gång i en liten by bodde en kvinna som heter marion.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
med sin enda dotter var narcisa marion extremt ödmjuk och söt narcisa men var helt tvärtom ser du att hon var vacker utöver ord hon var som en levande.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
docka och den mest underhållande delen är att hon älskade sig själv utan syfte narcisa skulle du.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hjälp mig att baka brödet va inget sätt mamma mjölstädarna alla mina ljusa och glittrande ögon.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"narcisa skulle du hjälpa mig att plantera dessa frön, varför skulle jag göra det, vad har jag fått all smuts på mina vackra fingrar, värre om det skulle gå i ansiktet, det var problemet med narcisa.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hon tyckte sig vara för stor för att göra något arbete som många friare kom för att be om narcissus i äktenskapet.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
eftersom hennes skönhet var känd vidsträckt men hon avvisade dem alla väldigt oförskämt varför skickade du bort dessa män igår de verkade trevliga du kan inte vara seriös mamma en av dem.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hade så små ögon nästan som en fågel och den andra hade en enorm näsa jag skulle inte vilja vara nära honom.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"när han nysade åh åh och sista stoppet nej, jag vill inte höra mer allt jag kunde se var att de här männen var riktigt trevliga min kära, du måste veta den skönheten.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
är inte allt mamma du måste inse att jag förtjänar någon som en prins eller en riddare.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
åh kära en natt när hon sov satt hennes mamma vid hennes sida och tittade på henne.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
min kära barn du är så vacker och vacker men du bryr dig inte om något annat än din skönhet.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
i det ögonblicket började narciss skratta i sömnen hennes mamma var mycket förvånad över hur trevlig hon måste ha en riktigt rolig dröm nästa morgon när narcissus.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Jag vaknade, hon var alla leende och fnissar här älskling berätta vad du drömde om.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
igår kväll mamma det var en så fantastisk dröm du vet att det var den här prinsen som kom fram till mig.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
och sa att han ville gifta sig med mig han hade kommit i en gyllene vagn och han var klädd uppifrån och ner och guld också vilken dum dröm.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
och du vet att den bästa delen av det var när jag var i min bröllopsklänning som var av guld också såklart alla stirrade bara på mig narcisa det finns inget fantastiskt med den drömmen.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
det var en mycket egoistisk drömmamma du vet inte vad du säger att drömmen har fått mig att inse att jag behöver mat mycket större än den typ jag äter här hemma bröd av guld.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tänk bara på att den stackars narcissemamma var så orolig för sin dotter och hur.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hon skulle leva sitt liv den dagen två vänner kom för att besöka narcissmamma de var mellie och terry de tre av dem hade varit vänner i åldrar men terry och ellie hade en hemlighet båda.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"var magiska varelser något som narcisses mamma visste ingenting om terry melli oh det är så bra att se dig det har varit väldigt länge hasn ' t det hur har du varit jag har varit väldigt bra jag skulle ha varit bättre om bara om bara vad om bara min dotter narcisa var lite mer förstående marian berättade för mellie och terry allt om narcisa och hur hon var orolig för henne hon vill äta bröd av guld vad gör jag med henne, kanske om hennes dröm går i uppfyllelse.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
det skulle vara underbart skulle det inte vara bra oavsett jag antar att med tiden kommer hon att lära sig låt oss prata om något annat.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
nu senare vinkade mellie och terry farväl till sin gamla vän och gick bort leende till varandra hemligt den natten både mor och dotter.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
gjorde mig redo för sängmamma jag hoppas verkligen att min dröm går i uppfyllelse du vet åh narcisa nästa dag som narcisa och hennes mamma var ute i deras trädgård en vacker.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"gyllene vagnen kom ridande upp till dem, den var fylld av ädelstenar och diamanter och såg väldigt fantastisk ut.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
när det stoppade kom en stilig man ut ur den och tittade på narcisa hon blev helt förvånad över hur stilig han var min dröm faktiskt går i uppfyllelse umm.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
vad hej jag har kommit hit för att be om narcissus hand i äktenskap men hur vet du hennes namn och vem är du.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jag är Terrence ängeln med lycka din dotters namn och skönhet är känd över hela världen här jag har gett dig en gåva vad men du känner knappt honom du kan inte gå med honom.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
åh dumt han är rik och stilig vad mer kan jag vilja ha terrence jag accepterar ditt förslag.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
och med det gick hon in i vagnen och utan att ens säga adjö till sin mor åkte hon med ängeln när de färdade vagnen plötsligt in i en magisk portal där den reste genom ett stormigt område vagnen stötte enormt och narcissa.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
var väldigt rädd oroa dig inte min kära allt detta kommer snart att vara över precis som han sa att vagnen gick genom en annan portal och nådde uppfarten.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"av ett stort och magnifikt gyllene slott narcisa blev förvånad över all den skönhet hon såg att jag visste att jag förtjänar så många rikedomar jag visste att du skulle vilja ha det du vill ha här hittar du från de vackraste klänningarna till de godaste matarna allt i mitt palats väl talar om mat jag är verkligen hungrig efter den åkturen jag ' m svälter kan jag få något av den goda maten naturligtvis här kött illaluktande melissa hon kommer att få dig vad du vill jag har hört så mycket om dig du stackars kära du är hungrig är du inte kommer vi går till matbordet och Jag ska skaffa dig lite mat åh tack, de gick in i matsalen och där på bordet fanns den mest häpnadsväckande maten som narcisa någonsin hade sett fantastisk, det beror på att det är sylt som görs.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
av rubiner salladerna av smaragder och brödet där borta är gjorda av guldguldbröd hur härligt detta sylt kommer att se ut och smaka härligt med brödet hon tog en skiva med.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ruby jam på det och tog en enorm bit det är så varmt att jag inte kan äta så bra det är bröd av guld och det finaste också men om du inte kan äta ska jag skaffa dig silverbröd silver va varför inte du äter.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"något annat men jag vill ha normalt brödbröd som jag kan äta har du inte det utseendet till min fru till min far, det är kallt, du får bara äta den bästa narcis jag tittade på all mat.",Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
men var hjärtskadad för allt det var oätligt hon började snart gråta jag vill inte ha det här men maten är riktigt bra.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
här prova några gyllene potatis de är riktigt bra och när du är gift med mig.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
du måste äta allt detta jag trodde att du gillade snygga saker nej jag vill inte gifta mig med dig jag vill åka hem.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
till min mamma låt mig gå hem melissa och terrence tittade på varandra och blinkade bra.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
om det verkligen är vad du vill så tar jag dig hem med terrence tog gråt och olycklig.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
narcis hemma i vagnen började hon tänka djupt på de val hon hade gjort när hon kom hem.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hon sprang för att krama sin mor som satt i huset ledsen eller syster o min söta dotter jag trodde att jag aldrig skulle träffa dig igen.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
oh mamma jag älskar dig så mycket och du hade rätt utseende och rikedomar är inte allt guldbrödet var värdelöst eftersom jag inte kunde äta det och mannen trots att.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
han var stilig han brydde sig inte alls om mig men min kära inser du att det är precis så du behandlade andra jag vet att jag är så ledsen för hur jag agerade mamma åh nej det är okej eftersom du har sett.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
vad ditt misstag var kom låt oss mata dig något trevligt från och med den dagen.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
narcisa förändrade sätt som hon först kämpade men långsamt och tålmodigt började hon bli mycket trevligare en dag mellie och terry kom för att träffa marian igen oh hej ni två så berätta för oss marian.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
på vilket sätt' s narcissism berättade marian dem båda allt som hade hänt och hon har förändrats så mycket från den tiden.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
har hon antar hon att hon inte vill ha mer guldbröd nu va vet du.,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
frotté du ser faktiskt lite ut som den ängeln men vad ser jag hur kan du vara han ni är så trevliga,Sweedish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"نيتشر (بالإنجليزية: Nature)‏ قد تعني:    تعديل - تعديل مصدري - تعديل ويكي بيانات ويكيبيديا (تلفظ ‎[wi:ki:bi:dija:]‏ وتلحن ‎[wikipi:dia]‏؛ تلفظ بالإنجليزية ‎/ˌwɪkiˈpi:di.ə/‏)[7] والكلمة مشتقة من مقطعين: ويكي wiki وتعني بلغة هاواي ""بالغ السرعة""، والثاني بيديا pedia ومشتق من كلمة موسوعة encyclopedia، ويكيبيديا هي موسوعة متعددة اللغات، مبنية على الويب، ذات محتوى حر، تشغلها مؤسسة ويكيميديا، التي هي منظمة غير ربحية.",Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ويكيبيديا هي موسوعة يمكن لأي مستخدم تعديل وتحرير وإنشاء مقالات جديدة فيها.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
في مارس 2009 كان في ويكيبيديا 15 مليون مقالة تقريبًا، مكتوبة بما يقارب 292 لغة.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
في يوم 17 أغسطس، 2009: وصلت ويكيبيديا الإنجليزية لثلاثة ملايين مقالة.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[8] تكتب المقالات تعاونيًا بواسطة متطوعين من حول العالم والغالبية العظمى من محتويات الموسوعة يمكن تعديلها بواسطة أي شخص يمتلك اتصالاً بالإنترنت.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
شهرة ويكيبيديا تنمو بثبات منذ بداية عملها.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ويكيبيديا من الإنجليزية ويكيبيديا هي اختصار لكلمتين هما: ويكي بالإنجليزية Wiki (نوع من مواقع الويب التي يتم تحريرها جماعيا)، والكلمة الثانية هي بيديا من كلمة Encyclopedia والتي تعني بالعربية موسوعة.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
تنتشر خوادم ويكيبيديا الرئيسية في تامبا، فلوريدا، وخوادم أخرى موجودة في أمستردام وسيول.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
يعد ويكيبيديا من أشهر عشرة مواقع على الإنترنت على مستوى العالم.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[9] نتيجة لطبيعة ويكيبيديا التي تسمح لأي مستخدم بتعديل مقالاتها، شكك النقاد والمحللون بها وتساءلوا عن مدى مصداقيتها ودقتها.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[10][11] إذ أن بإمكان أي مستخدم أن يجري تعديلات على محتويات الموسوعة، تزيد احتمالية أن يضيف مجهولون أو مستخدمو الموسوعة المسجلون معلومات خاطئة أو غير مؤكدة، أو يقوم المخربون بحذف أقسام من مقالات أو إضافة تعليقات شخصية أو آراء متحيزة، خاصةً في المواضيع السياسية والدينية.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
أيضا تثار الشكوك حول حيادية المقالات في ويكيبيديا، ومدى دقة المعلومات الواردة بهذه المقالات.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
حدد القائمون على موسوعة ويكيبيديا مجموعة من السياسات والتعليمات التي يجب على مستخدمي الموسوعة الالتزام بها عند تحرير وتعديل محتويات الموسوعة، هذه السياسات تهدف إلى التصدي لمحاولات التخريب، وتحاول ضمان مصداقية المعلومات التي تحويها مقالات هذه الموسوعة.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
بدأ مشروع ويكيبيديا في 15 يناير 2001 كمتمم لمشروع نيوبيديا الذي يكتبه محررون خبراء.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
وبسبب بطء تطوّر نيوبيديا فقد قرّر جيمي ويلز ولاري سانجر أن ينشئا مشروعا مفتوحاً ليدعم نيوبيديا وهو ويكيبيديا.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
وأصبحت تحتوي على 600 ألف مقالة بالإنجليزية و2 مليون مقالة باللغات الأخرى مجتمعة حسب ما ذكر جيمي ويليز[7] اللغات الكبرى مثل الألمانية واليابانية والفرنسية واللغات الأوربية الغربية كبيرة أيضا، ثلث الزيارات فقط للإنجليزية على عكس ما يظن البعض، ومدى شهرة ويكيبيديا أنها من أكبر 50 موقعا في العالم وتعددت زيارات الصفحات زيارة صفحات النيويورك تيمز،[7] لدى نيويورك تيمز والمواقع الأخرى موظفين مسؤولين عن الموقع وهم كثيرين يتقاضون مرتبات، أما ويكيبيديا فيوجد واحد فقط وهو المطور للبرنامج نفسه وتم تعيينه منذ يناير 2005، والخوادم تتم إدارتها بواسطة متطوعين والتحرير يتم أيضا بواسطة متطوعين.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
تمت محاولة إنشاء موسوعات تعاونية أخرى عبر الإنترنت قبل ويكيبيديا، لكن لم يكن أي منها ناجحًا.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[12] بدأت ويكيبيديا كمشروع تكميلي لـ نيوبيديا، وهو مشروع موسوعة مجاني باللغة الإنجليزية على الإنترنت كتب مقالاته خبراء وتمت مراجعته في إطار عملية رسمية.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[13] تم تأسيسها في 9 مارس 2000، بملكية بوميس، وهي شركة بوابة إلكترونية.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
شخصياتها الرئيسية كانت الرئيس التنفيذي لشركة بوميس جيمي ويلز ولاري سانجر، رئيس تحرير نيوبيديا ولاحقًا ويكيبيديا.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
تم ترخيص نيوبيديا في البداية بموجب ترخيص نيوبيديا المحتوى الحر الخاص بها، ولكن حتى قبل تأسيس ويكيبيديا، تحولت نيوبيديا إلى ترخيص التوثيق المجاني GNU بناءً على طلب ريتشارد ستالمان.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
يرجع الفضل إلى ويلز في تحديد الهدف المتمثل في إنشاء موسوعة عامة قابلة للتحرير،   بينما يُنسب إلى سانجر استراتيجية استخدام الويكي للوصول إلى هذا الهدف.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[14] في 10 يناير 2001، اقترح سانجر على القائمة البريدية لـ نيوبيديا إنشاء ويكي كمشروع ""تغذية"" لـ نيوبيديا.",Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[15] تم تسجيل النطاقات Wikipedia.com وWikipedia.org يوم 12 يناير 2001،[16] و13 يناير 2001،[17] على التوالي، وأطلقت ويكيبيديا في 15 كانون الثاني 2001،[13] كما في اللغة الإنجليزية واحدة طبعة في www.Wikipedia.com،  وأعلن عنها سانجر في القائمة البريدية لـ نيوبيديا.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"تم تدوين سياسة ويكيبيديا الخاصة بـ ""وجهة نظر محايدة"" في الأشهر القليلة الأولى لها.",Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
بخلاف ذلك، كانت هناك قواعد قليلة نسبيًا في البداية وعملت ويكيبيديا بشكل مستقل عن نيوبيديا.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
في الأصل، كان بوميس ينوي جعل ويكيبيديا شركة من أجل الربح.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[18] اكتسبت ويكيبيديا مساهمين مبكرين من نيوبيديا ومنشورات سلاش دوت وفهرسة محرك بحث الويب.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
كما تم إنشاء إصدارات اللغة، بإجمالي 161 طبعة بنهاية عام 2004.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[19] تعايش نيوبيديا و ويكيبيديا حتى تم إزالة خوادم الأولى بشكل دائم في عام 2003، وتم دمج نصها في ويكيبيديا.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
تجاوزت ويكيبيديا الإنجليزية علامة مليوني مقال في 9 سبتمبر 2007، مما يجعلها أكبر موسوعة تم تجميعها على الإطلاق، متجاوزة موسوعة يونجل التي تم إجراؤها خلال عهد أسرة مينج عام 1408، والتي سجلت الرقم القياسي لما يقرب من 600 سنوات.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
نقلاً عن مخاوف من الإعلانات التجارية وعدم وجود سيطرة في ويكيبيديا، قام مستخدمو ويكيبيديا الإسبانية بالتشعب من ويكيبيديا لإنشاء الموسوعة الحرة بالإسبانية في فبراير 2002.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[20] أعلن ويلز بعد ذلك أن ويكيبيديا لن تعرض إعلانات، وغيرت مجال ويكيبيديا من Wikipedia.com إلى Wikipedia.org.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[21] على الرغم من أن ويكيبيديا الإنجليزية وصلت إلى ثلاثة ملايين مقال في أغسطس 2009، إلا أن نمو الطبعة، من حيث عدد المقالات الجديدة والمساهمين، يبدو أنه قد بلغ ذروته في أوائل عام 2007.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[22] تمت إضافة حوالي 1800 مقال يوميًا إلى الموسوعة في عام 2006 ؛ بحلول عام 2013 كان هذا المتوسط حوالي 800.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[23] عزا فريق في مركز بالو ألتو للأبحاث هذا التباطؤ في النمو إلى التفرد المتزايد للمشروع ومقاومته للتغيير.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[24] يقترح البعض الآخر أن النمو يتم تسويته بشكل طبيعي لأن المقالات التي يمكن تسميتها "" الفاكهة المتدلية "" - الموضوعات التي تستحق مقالًا بوضوح - قد تم إنشاؤها بالفعل وبنائها على نطاق واسع.",Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[25][26][27] في نوفمبر 2009، وجد باحث في جامعة راي خوان كارلوس في مدريد أن ويكيبيديا الإنجليزية فقدت 49000 محرر خلال الأشهر الثلاثة الأولى من عام 2009؛ بالمقارنة، فقد المشروع 4900 محرر فقط خلال نفس الفترة من عام 2008.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[28][29] استشهدت صحيفة وول ستريت جورنال بمجموعة من القواعد المطبقة على التحرير والنزاعات المتعلقة بمثل هذا المحتوى من بين أسباب هذا الاتجاه.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[30] عارض ويلز هذه الادعاءات في عام 2009، نافياً التراجع وشكك في منهجية الدراسة.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[31] بعد ذلك بعامين، في عام 2011، أقرت ويلز بوجود انخفاض طفيف، مشيرة إلى انخفاض من ""أكثر بقليل من 36000 كاتب"" في يونيو 2010 إلى 35800 في يونيو 2011.",Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"في المقابلة نفسها، زعم ويلز أيضًا أن عدد المحررين كان ""مستقرًا ومستدامًا"".",Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[32] شكك مقال عام 2013 بعنوان ""The Decline of ويكيبيديا"" في  إم آي تي تكنولوجي ريفيو هذا الادعاء.",Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
كشف المقال أنه منذ عام 2007، فقدت ويكيبيديا ثلث محرريها المتطوعين، وهؤلاء الذين ما زالوا هناك يركزون بشكل متزايد على التفاصيل.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[33] في يوليو 2012، أفادت ذا أتلانتيك أن عدد المسؤولين في انخفاض أيضًا.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[34] في عدد 25 نوفمبر 2013 من مجلة نيويورك، صرحت كاثرين وارد أن ""ويكيبيديا، الموقع السادس الأكثر استخدامًا، يواجه أزمة داخلية"".",Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[35] في كانون الثاني (يناير) 2007، دخلت ويكيبيديا لأول مرة قائمة العشرة الأوائل لمواقع الويب الأكثر شعبية في الولايات المتحدة، وفقًا لشبكات كوم سكور.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
مع 42.9 مليون زائر، احتلت ويكيبيديا المرتبة 9، متجاوزة نيويورك تايمز (رقم 10) وأبل (رقم 11).,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
يمثل هذا زيادة كبيرة عن يناير 2006، عندما كانت المرتبة رقم 33، مع ويكيبيديا التي تلقت حوالي 18.3 مليون زائر.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[36] اعتبارا من مارس 2020[تحديث]، ويكيبيديا تحتل المرتبة 13  بين المواقع من حيث الشعبية وفقًا لموقع أليكسا إنترنت.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
في عام 2014، تلقت ثمانية مليارات مشاهدة للصفحة كل شهر.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[37] في 9 فبراير 2014، ذكرت صحيفة نيويورك تايمز أن ويكيبيديا لديها 18 مليار مشاهدة للصفحة وما يقرب من 500 مليون زائر فريد شهريًا ""وفقًا لشركة التصنيف comScore"".",Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[38] يجادل لوفلاند وريجل بأن ويكيبيديا تتبع تقليدًا طويلًا من الموسوعات التاريخية التي تراكمت عليها تحسينات تدريجية من خلال ""التراكم الوصمي"".",Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[39][40] في 18 يناير 2012، شاركت ويكيبيديا الإنجليزية في سلسلة من الاحتجاجات المنسقة ضد قانونين مقترحين في كونغرس الولايات المتحدة - قانون وقف القرصنة عبر الإنترنت (SOPA) وقانون حماية الملكية الفكرية (PIPA) - بحجب صفحاتها لمدة 24 ساعات.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[41]  شاهد أكثر من 162 مليون شخص صفحة شرح التعتيم التي حلت محل محتوى ويكيبيديا مؤقتًا.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[42][43] في 20 كانون الثاني (يناير) 2014، أشارت تقارير سوبود فارما لصحيفة إيكونوميك تايمز إلى أنه لم يتوقف نمو ويكيبيديا فحسب، بل ""فقد ما يقرب من عشرة بالمائة من مشاهدات صفحاتها العام الماضي.",Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
كان هناك انخفاض بنحو ملياري شخص بين ديسمبر 2012 وديسمبر 2013.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
تتصدر نسخها الأكثر شيوعًا الشريحة: انخفضت مشاهدات صفحات ويكيبيديا الإنجليزية بنسبة اثني عشر بالمائة، وتراجعت تلك الخاصة بالنسخة الألمانية بنسبة 17 بالمائة وخسرت النسخة اليابانية تسعة بالمائة.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"""[44] عند الاتصال بهذا الأمر، أشار كلي شيركي، الأستاذ المساعد في جامعة نيويورك والزميل في مركز بيركمان للإنترنت والمجتمع بجامعة هارفارد، إلى أنه يشتبه في أن الكثير من رفض عرض الصفحة يرجع إلى الرسوم البيانية المعرفية، قائلاً، ""إذا كان بإمكانك الحصول على سؤالك من صفحة البحث، فلست بحاجة إلى النقر فوق [المزيد].",Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[44] بحلول نهاية ديسمبر 2016، احتلت ويكيبيديا المرتبة الخامسة في أكثر المواقع شعبية على مستوى العالم.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[45] في يناير 2013، سميت ويكيبيديا 274301، كويكب، على اسم ويكيبيديا؛ في أكتوبر 2014، تم تكريم ويكيبيديا بنصب ويكيبيديا التذكاري؛ وفي يوليو 2015، أصبح 106 من 7473 700 مجلدًا من ويكيبيديا متاحًا كطباعة ويكيبيديا.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
في عام 2019، تم تسمية نوع من النباتات المزهرة فيولا ويكيبيديا.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[46] في أبريل 2019، تحطمت مركبة هبوط إسرائيلية على سطح القمر، بيريشيت، وتحمل نسخة من جميع مقالات ويكيبيديا الإنجليزية تقريبًا منقوشة على ألواح رقيقة من النيكل؛ يقول الخبراء إن اللوحات ربما نجت من الانهيار [47][48] في يونيو 2019، أفاد العلماء أن جميع الـ 16 تم ترميز غيغابايت من نص المقالة من ويكيبيديا الإنجليزية في DNA اصطناعي.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[49] على عكس الموسوعات التقليدية، تتبع ويكيبيديا مبدأ التسويف فيما يتعلق بأمان محتواها.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
لقد بدأ مفتوحًا بالكامل تقريبًا - يمكن لأي شخص إنشاء مقالات، ويمكن تحرير أي مقالة على ويكيبيديا بواسطة أي قارئ، حتى أولئك الذين ليس لديهم حساب على ويكيبيديا.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
سيتم نشر التعديلات على جميع المقالات على الفور.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ونتيجة لذلك، يمكن أن تحتوي أي مقالة على معلومات غير دقيقة مثل الأخطاء والتحيزات الأيديولوجية والنص غير المنطقي أو غير ذي الصلة.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
نظرًا لتزايد شعبية ويكيبيديا، أدخلت بعض الإصدارات، بما في ذلك النسخة الإنجليزية، قيودًا على التحرير في بعض الحالات.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
على سبيل المثال، في ويكيبيديا الإنجليزية وبعض إصدارات اللغات الأخرى، يمكن للمستخدمين المسجلين فقط إنشاء مقال جديد.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[50] على ويكيبيديا الإنجليزية، من بين صفحات أخرى، تمت حماية بعض الصفحات المثيرة للجدل أو الحساسة أو المعرضة للتخريب إلى حد ما.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[51][52] مقال للتخريب في كثير من الأحيان يمكن أن تكون شبه محمية أو محمية بشكل كامل، وهذا يعني أنه ليس هناك سوى مستويات صلاحيات معينة حتى تستطيع تعديله.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[53] قد يتم قفل مقال مثير للجدل بشكل خاص حتى يتمكن المسؤولون فقط من إجراء تغييرات.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[54] في حالات معينة، يُسمح لجميع المحررين بإرسال تعديلات، لكن المراجعة مطلوبة لبعض المحررين، اعتمادًا على شروط معينة.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"على سبيل المثال، تحتفظ ويكيبيديا الألمانية ""بنسخ ثابتة"" من المقالات،[55] التي اجتازت مراجعات معينة.",Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"بعد التجارب المطولة والمناقشات المجتمعية، قدمت ويكيبيديا الإنجليزية نظام ""التغييرات المعلقة"" في ديسمبر 2012.",Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[56] في ظل هذا النظام، تتم مراجعة تعديلات المستخدمين الجدد وغير المسجلين على بعض المقالات المثيرة للجدل أو المعرضة للتخريب من قبل المستخدمين المعروفين قبل نشرها.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[57] على الرغم من عدم مراجعة التغييرات بشكل منهجي، فإن البرنامج الذي يشغل ويكيبيديا يوفر أدوات معينة تسمح لأي شخص بمراجعة التغييرات التي أجراها الآخرون.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ترتبط صفحة ""التاريخ"" الخاصة بكل مقالة بكل مراجعة.",Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[note 1]  في معظم المقالات، يمكن لأي شخص التراجع عن تغييرات الآخرين بالنقر فوق ارتباط في صفحة محفوظات المقالة.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"يمكن لأي شخص عرض أحدث التغييرات التي تم إجراؤها على المقالات، ويمكن لأي شخص الاحتفاظ "" بقائمة مراقبة"" للمقالات التي تهمه حتى يتم إخطاره بأي تغييرات.",Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""دورية الصفحات الجديدة"" هي عملية يتم من خلالها فحص المقالات المنشأة حديثًا بحثًا عن مشاكل واضحة.",Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"جادل الطالب أندريا سيفوليلي بأن تكاليف المعاملات المنخفضة للمشاركة في ويكي تخلق حافزًا للتطوير التعاوني، وأن ميزات مثل السماح بسهولة الوصول إلى الإصدارات السابقة من الصفحة تفضل ""البناء الإبداعي"" على ""التدمير الإبداعي"".",Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[59] أي تغيير أو تعديل يتلاعب بالمحتوى بطريقة تضر بشكل مقصود بسلامة ويكيبيديا يعتبر تخريبًا.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
تشمل أكثر أنواع التخريب شيوعًا ووضوحًا إضافات البذاءة والفكاهة الفظة.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
يمكن أن يشمل التخريب أيضًا الإعلانات وأنواعًا أخرى من البريد العشوائي.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
أحيانًا يرتكب المحررون أعمال تخريب عن طريق إزالة المحتوى أو إفراغ صفحة معينة تمامًا.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
قد يكون من الصعب اكتشاف الأنواع الأقل شيوعًا من التخريب، مثل الإضافة المتعمدة لمعلومات معقولة ولكنها خاطئة إلى مقالة.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
يمكن للمخربين تقديم تنسيق غير ذي صلة، أو تعديل دلالات الصفحة مثل عنوان الصفحة أو تصنيفها، أو التلاعب بالشفرة الأساسية للمقالة، أو استخدام الصور بشكل معطل.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
من السهل بشكل عام إزالة التخريب الواضح من مقالات ويكيبيديا؛ متوسط الوقت اللازم لكشف التخريب وإصلاحه هو بضع دقائق.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ومع ذلك، فإن بعض أعمال التخريب تستغرق وقتًا أطول لإصلاحها.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
في حادثة سيرة جون سيجنثالر، قدم محرر مجهول معلومات كاذبة في سيرة الشخصية السياسية الأمريكية جون سيجنثالر في مايو 2005.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
تم تقديم سيجنثالر كذباً كمشتبه به في اغتيال جون ف.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
كينيدي.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
بقي المقال غير مصحح لمدة أربعة أشهر.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
دعا سيجنثالر، مدير التحرير المؤسس لـ يو إس إيه توداي ومؤسس مركز التعديل الأول لمنتدى الحرية في جامعة فاندربيلت، جيمي ويلز المؤسس المشارك لـ ويكيبيديا وسأل عما إذا كان لديه أي طريقة لمعرفة من ساهم في المعلومات المضللة.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
رد ويلز بأنه لم يفعل ذلك، على الرغم من تعقب الجاني في النهاية.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[60][61] بعد الحادثة، وصف سيجنثالر ويكيبيديا بأنها ""أداة بحث معيبة وغير مسؤولة"".",Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
أدى هذا الحادث إلى تغييرات في السياسة في ويكيبيديا، استهدفت تحديدًا تشديد إمكانية التحقق من مقالات السيرة الذاتية للناس الأحياء.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[62] في عام 2010، شجع دانيال توش مشاهدي برنامجه، توش.0، على زيارة مقال ويكيبيديا الخاص بالعرض وتحريره حسب الرغبة.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
في حلقة لاحقة، علق على التعديلات التي تم إجراؤها على المقالة، ومعظمها مسيئة، والتي تم إجراؤها من قبل الجمهور ودفعت إلى منع المقال من التحرير.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[63][64] غالبًا ما يكون لدى مستخدمي ويكيبيديا نزاعات بشأن المحتوى، مما قد يؤدي إلى إجراء تغييرات متكررة معاكسة لمقالة، تُعرف باسم حرب التحرير.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[65][66] العملية عبارة عن سيناريو مستهلك للموارد حيث لا يتم إضافة معرفة مفيدة.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[67] تم انتقاد هذه الممارسة أيضًا على أنها تخلق ثقافة تحرير تنافسية[68] قائمة على الصراع[69] مرتبطة بأدوار الذكور التقليدية بين الجنسين،[70] مما يساهم في التحيز الجنساني على ويكيبيديا.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
يخضع المحتوى في ويكيبيديا للقوانين (على وجه الخصوص، قوانين حقوق النشر) للولايات المتحدة وولاية فيرجينيا الأمريكية، حيث توجد غالبية خوادم ويكيبيديا.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"بعيدًا عن المسائل القانونية، تتجسد المبادئ التحريرية لويكيبيديا في ""خمس اعمده"" وفي العديد من سياسات وإرشادات تهدف إلى تشكيل المحتوى بشكل مناسب.",Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
حتى هذه القواعد مخزنة في شكل ويكي، ويقوم محررو ويكيبيديا بكتابة ومراجعة سياسات وإرشادات الموقع.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[71] يمكن للمحررين تطبيق هذه القواعد عن طريق حذف أو تعديل المواد غير المتوافقة.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
في الأصل، استندت القواعد الخاصة بالإصدارات غير الإنجليزية من ويكيبيديا إلى ترجمة قواعد ويكيبيديا الإنجليزية.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
لقد تباعدوا منذ ذلك الحين إلى حد ما.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[72] وفقًا للقواعد الموجودة في ويكيبيديا الإنجليزية، يجب أن يكون كل إدخال في ويكيبيديا حول موضوع موسوعي وليس إدخال قاموس أو نمط قاموس.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[73] يجب أن يفي الموضوع أيضًا بمعايير ويكيبيديا الخاصة بـ ""الملحوظة""،[74] مما يعني عمومًا أنه يجب تغطية الموضوع في وسائل الإعلام الرئيسية أو مصادر المجلات الأكاديمية الرئيسية المستقلة عن موضوع المقالة.",Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
علاوة على ذلك، تنوي ويكيبيديا نقل المعرفة التي تم تأسيسها ومعترف بها بالفعل.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
يجب ألا يقدم بحثًا أصليًا.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
الادعاء الذي من المحتمل أن يتم الطعن فيه يتطلب إشارة إلى مصدر موثوق.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"بين محرري ويكيبيديا، غالبًا ما يتم التعبير عن هذا على أنه ""إمكانية التحقق، وليس الحقيقة"" للتعبير عن فكرة أن القراء، وليس الموسوعة، هم المسؤولون في النهاية عن التحقق من صحة المقالات وعمل تفسيراتهم الخاصة.",Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[75] يمكن أن يؤدي هذا في بعض الأحيان إلى إزالة المعلومات التي، على الرغم من صحتها، لم يتم الحصول عليها بشكل صحيح.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[76] أخيرًا، يجب ألا تنحاز ويكيبيديا إلى أي طرف.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
يجب أن تتمتع جميع الآراء ووجهات النظر، إذا كانت منسوبة إلى مصادر خارجية، بنصيب مناسب من التغطية داخل المقالة.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
يُعرف هذا باسم وجهة نظر محايدة (NPOV).,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
مجموعة أخرى من المتطوعين هم الإداريون، البيروقراطيون، المضيفون، مدققو المستخدم، سفراء بين اللغات الأخرى لويكيبيديا... الإداريون هم مجموعة من المستخدمين الذين لهم ميزات خاصة.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
من هذه الميزات القدرة على حذف الصفحات واسترجاعها، حماية وإزالة حماية الصفحات ومنع المستخدمين من التحرير.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
تمول ويكيبيديا بواسطة مؤسسة ويكيميديا، في الربع الرابع من سنة 2005 تم صرف 321.000 دولار أمريكي على ويكيبيديا، 60% من المصروفات كانت على المكونات المادية.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[77] تعتمد ويكيميديا على التبرعات بشكل أساسي.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[78] بمرور الوقت، طورت ويكيبيديا عملية تسوية نزاع شبه رسمية للمساعدة في مثل هذه الظروف.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"لتحديد إجماع المجتمع، يمكن للمحررين إثارة المشكلات في منتديات المجتمع المناسبة،[note 2] أو السعي للحصول على مدخلات خارجية من خلال طلب رأي ثالث أو عن طريق بدء مناقشة مجتمعية عامة تعرف باسم ""طلب التعليق"".",Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
مجلس التحكيم هو العملية النهائية لتسوية المنازعات.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
على الرغم من أن الخلافات تنشأ عادة من الخلاف بين رأيين متعارضين حول كيفية قراءة مقال ما، فإن لجنة التحكيم ترفض صراحة الحكم مباشرة على وجهة النظر المحددة التي ينبغي اعتمادها.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
تشير التحليلات الإحصائية إلى أن اللجنة تتجاهل محتوى النزاعات وتركز بدلاً من ذلك على طريقة إدارة النزاعات، لا تعمل كثيرًا لحل النزاعات وإحلال السلام بين المحررين المتضاربين، ولكن للتخلص من المحررين الذين يعانون من مشاكل مع السماح للمحررين المنتجين بالعودة للمشاركة.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
لذلك، لا تملي اللجنة محتوى المقالات، على الرغم من أنها تدين أحيانًا تغييرات المحتوى عندما ترى أن المحتوى الجديد ينتهك سياسات ويكيبيديا (على سبيل المثال، إذا تم اعتبار المحتوى الجديد متحيزًا).,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
تشمل علاجاته التنبيهات (المستخدمة في 63% من الحالات) ومنع المحررين من تحرير المقالات (43%) أو الموضوعات (23%) أو ويكيبيديا (16%).,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
عمومًا، يقتصر الحظر الكامل من ويكيبيديا على حالات انتحال الهوية والسلوك المعادي للمجتمع .,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
عندما لا يكون السلوك انتحالًا للهوية أو معاديًا للمجتمع، ولكنه مخالف للإجماع أو ينتهك سياسات التحرير، تميل العلاجات إلى أن تقتصر على التحذيرات.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[79] كل مقال وكل مستخدم في ويكيبيديا له صفحة ""نقاش"" مرتبطة به.",Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
هذه تشكل قناة الاتصال الأساسية للمحررين للمناقشة والتنسيق والمناقشة.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[80] تم وصف مجتمع ويكيبيديا بأنه مجموعة اجتماعية،[81] على الرغم من أنه ليس دائمًا مع دلالات سلبية تمامًا.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[82] تمت الإشارة إلى تفضيل المشروع للتماسك، حتى لو كان يتطلب حل وسط يتضمن تجاهل أوراق الاعتماد، على أنه "" معاداة النخبوية "".",Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[83] أحيانًا ما يكافئ الويكيبيديون بأوسمة مقابل العمل الجيد.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
تكشف رموز التقدير الشخصية هذه عن مجموعة واسعة من الأعمال القيمة التي تمتد إلى ما هو أبعد من التحرير البسيط لتشمل الدعم الاجتماعي والإجراءات الإدارية وأنواع أعمال التعبير.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[84] لا تتطلب ويكيبيديا من المحررين والمساهمين تقديم التعريف.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"مع نمو ويكيبيديا، ""من يكتب ويكيبيديا؟"" أصبح أحد الأسئلة المتداولة حول المشروع.",Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[85] جادل جيمي ويلز ذات مرة بأن ""المجتمع ... مجموعة مكرسة من بضع مئات من المتطوعين ""تقدم الجزء الأكبر من المساهمات في ويكيبيديا، وبالتالي فإن المشروع يشبه إلى حد كبير أي منظمة تقليدية"".",Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[86] في عام 2008، ذكرت مقالة في مجلة Slate أن: ""وفقًا للباحثين في Palo Alto، فإن واحد بالمائة من مستخدمي ويكيبيديا مسؤولون عن حوالي نصف تعديلات الموقع"".",Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[87] وقد اعترض آرون شوارتز على هذه الطريقة في تقييم المساهمات لاحقًا، حيث أشار إلى أن العديد من المقالات التي أخذ عينات منها تحتوي على أجزاء كبيرة من محتواها (تقاس بعدد الأحرف) التي ساهم بها المستخدمون الذين لديهم أعداد تحرير منخفضة.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[88] وجدت دراسة أجراها باحثون من كلية دارتموث عام 2007 أن ""المساهمين المجهولين وغير المتكررين في ويكيبيديا [...] هم مصدر موثوق للمعرفة مثل أولئك المساهمين الذين يسجلون في الموقع"".",Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[89] صرح جيمي ويلز في عام 2009 أنه ""[أنا] اتضح أن أكثر من 50% من جميع التعديلات تمت من قبل.7% فقط من المستخدمين... 524 شخصا.",Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
وفي الحقيقة، فإن أكثر 2% نشاطاً، أي 1400 شخص، قاموا بـ 73.4% من جميع التعديلات.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""[90] ومع ذلك، أظهر محرر بيزنس إنسايدر والصحفي هنري بلودجيت في عام 2009 أنه في عينة عشوائية من المقالات، يتم إنشاء معظم المحتوى في ويكيبيديا (يقاس بمقدار النص الذي تم المساهمة به حتى آخر تعديل للعينة) بواسطة ""الغيرالمسجليين""، في حين أن معظم عمليات التحرير ويتم التنسيق بواسطة ""المسجليين"".",Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[90] وجدت دراسة أجريت في عام 2008 أن سكان ويكيبيديين كانوا أقل قبولًا وانفتاحًا وضميرًا من الآخرين،[91][92] على الرغم من أن التعليق اللاحق أشار إلى عيوب خطيرة، بما في ذلك أن البيانات أظهرت انفتاحًا أعلى وأن الاختلافات مع المجموعة الضابطة والعينات كانت صغيرة.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[93] وفقًا لدراسة أجريت عام 2009، هناك ""دليل على تزايد المقاومة من مجتمع ويكيبيديا للمحتوى الجديد"".",Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[94] أظهرت العديد من الدراسات أن معظم المساهمين في ويكيبيديا هم من الذكور.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
والجدير بالذكر أن نتائج استطلاع مؤسسة ويكيميديا في عام 2008 أظهرت أن 13 في المائة فقط من محرري ويكيبيديا كانوا من الإناث.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[95] لهذا السبب، حاولت الجامعات في جميع أنحاء الولايات المتحدة تشجيع الإناث على أن يصبحن مساهمات في ويكيبيديا.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
وبالمثل، فإن العديد من هذه الجامعات، بما في ذلك ييل وبراون، أعطت ائتمانًا جامعيًا للطلاب الذين قاموا بإنشاء أو تحرير مقالة تتعلق بالنساء في العلوم أو التكنولوجيا.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[96] كتب أندرو ليه، الأستاذ والعالم، في صحيفة نيويورك تايمز أن السبب وراء اعتقاده أن عدد المساهمين الذكور يفوق عدد الإناث إلى حد كبير هو أن التعريف على أنه امرأة قد تعرض نفسها ""لسلوك قبيح ومخيف"".",Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[97] أظهرت البيانات أن الأفارقة ممثلون تمثيلا ناقصا بين محرري ويكيبيديا.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[98] توزيع 55٬723٬855 المقالات بإصدارات بلغات مختلفة (اعتبارًا من يناير 30, 2021)[99] يوجد حاليًا 313 إصدار لغة من ويكيبيديا.",Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
اعتبارًا من كانون الثاني (يناير) 2021، كانت المراكز الستة الأكبر، بترتيب عدد المقالات، هي ويكيبيديا English، وCebuano، وSwedish، وGerman، وFrench، وDutch.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
يدين ثاني وثالث أكبر مواقع ويكيبيديا إلى بوت Lsjbot الذي أنشأ المقالات، والذي أنشأ اعتبارًا من عام 2013 حوالي نصف المقالات في ويكيبيديا السويدية، ومعظم المقالات في  السيبوانية و ويكيبيديا واراي واراي.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
هذه الأخيرة هي لغتا الفلبين.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"بالإضافة إلى المراكز الستة الأولى، هناك اثنا عشر موقعًا آخر في ويكيبيديا بها أكثر من مليون مقال (الروسية والإيطالية والإسبانية والبولندية والواراي والفيتنامية واليابانية والصينية والمصرية والعربية والبرتغالية والأوكرانية)، ستة أخرى بها أكثر من 500,000 مقالة (الفارسية والكتالونية والصربية والإندونيسية والنرويجية والكورية)، لدى 43 آخرين أكثر من 100,000، و 82 آخرون لديهم أكثر من 10000.",Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
أكبرها، ويكيبيديا الإنجليزية، لديها أكثر من 6.2 مليون مقال.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
اعتبارًا من يناير 2019، وفقًا لـ أليكسا، يتلقى المجال الفرعي الإنجليزي (en.wikipedia.org ؛ ويكيبيديا الإنجليزية) ما يقرب من 57% من حركة المرور التراكمية في ويكيبيديا، مع الانقسام المتبقي بين اللغات الأخرى (الروسية: 9%؛ الصينية: 6%؛ اليابانية: 6%؛ الإسبانية: 5%).,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
وتعتمد ويكيبيديا على برنامج ميدياويكي، وهو برنامج ويكي مفتوح المصدر مرخص تحت رخصة جنو العمومية.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
مبني بلغة بي إتش بي، ويعتمد على قواعد بيانات ماي إس كيو إل.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
يقدم هذا البرنامج العديد من المزايا البرمجية، مثل الماكرو، والمتغيرات.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
يستخدم هذا البرنامج في ويكيبيديا ومشاريع ويكيميديا الأخرى بالإضافة إلى العديد من مواقع الويكي.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
تعمل خوادم ويكيبيديا بنظام جنو/لينكس.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
300 خادم في فلوريدا، 26 في أمستردام، و 23 في مركز استضافة شركة ياهو في سيول.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"تتلقى خوادم ويكيبيديا من 20,000 إلى 45,000 طلب صفحة في الثانية، وهذا حسب الوقت في اليوم الواحد.",Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"وصُفت ويكيبيديا بأنها ""مجهود لإنشاء وتوزيع موسوعة ذات أفضل جودة ممكنة لكل فرد على الكوكب بلغته الأم"".",Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[100] في النصف الثاني من أغسطس 2009 كانت ويكيبيديا تصدر بأكثر من 260 لغة.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"الإصدارات ال27 الأولى من حيث عدد المقالات كل واحدة منها يحتوي على أكثر من 100,000 مقالة، والـ174 الأولى تحتوي كل منها على أكثر من 1000 مقالة.",Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[1] الآن تصدر ب301 لغة منها 291 لغة نشطة.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
لما كانت ويكيبيديا موسوعة متاحة عبر الويب، فهي موسوعة عالمية، وقد يستخدم المشاركون الذين يستخدمون نفس اللغة لهجات متباينة، أو ربما يأتون من بلاد مختلفة (هذه هي الحال في العديد من الويكيبيديات، منها الويكيبيديا الإنجليزية والصينية)، هذا قد يؤدي إلى اختلافات في التهجئة،[101] أو في وجهات النظر.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
يتلقى نطاق ويكيبيديا الإنجليزية 57% من مجموع زوار ويكيبديا، 16% لويكيبيديا الإسبانية، 4% لويكيبيديا الألمانية، ونفس النسبة لويكيبيديا اليابانية، أما ويكيبيديا العربية فتتلقى 1% من زوار ويكيبيديا.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[102] يمكن للمحررين في إحدى موسوعات ويكيبيديا أن يترجموا المقالات من لغة إلى لغة أخرى، وهذا يلقى تشجيعاً في مجتمع ويكيبيديا (انظر:ويكيبيديا:ترجمة مقالات للعربية).,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
المقالات الموجودة بأكثر من لغة يمكن ربطها بروابط إنترويكي، يمكن ملاحظة هذه الروابط في قائمة في الجانب الأيمن من صفحة المقال.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
الصور والوسائط المتعددة الأخرى يتم تشاركها من خلال مشروع ويكيميديا كومنز.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
جملة من الانتقادات التي وجهت لويكيبيديا، منذ نشأتها: بسبب طريقة تحرير المقالات من خلال نظام الويكي الذي يسمح لأي شخص إضافة وتعديل وحذف معلومات من معظم مقالات ويكيبيديا، اتهم بعض المتخصصين الويكي، بكونها ليست ذات مرجعية.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
عبارة: نص ضعيف بمصدر، أفضل من كتابة جيدة غير موثوقة، تدل على أن المحررين المجهولين، لا يمكن تتبعهم، أو مناقشتهم، للاستفادة منهم، أو لمجادلتهم.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
يجيب إداريو الويكي، أن هذا يشجع الزوار الجدد على الإضافة، بإغرائهم للتغيير، والاستفادة ولو بتلميحات عديدة منهم، كما أنه غالباً ما يدفع هؤلاء المحررين للتسجيل في آخر المطاف.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
كما أن دراسات لتأثير التخريب، أثبتت أنه لا داعي في المبالغة بتأثيره، غالباً، ما تكون المقالات المحايدة، أطول مدة وأكثر استقرارا.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
إن مختلف صلاحيات إداريي الويكي، تمكنهم من حماية المقالات التي تحتاج مراقبة مكثفة، أو تتعرض لتخريب متنوع، كمقالات البلدان مثلا، أو المقالات عن المواضيع الدينية والسياسية.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
لا يوفر كل المساهمين مصادر لكتاباتهم، طبيعة عمل ويكيبيديا هذه جعلتها موضعاً للشك في مصداقية محتوياتها؛.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[103] أجرى خبراء جامعيون أستراليون دراسة حول ويكيبيديا وطريقة تحرير المقالات فيها، ووجدوا أن مواضيع ويكيبيديا يحررها أعضاء يتعاونون فيما بينهم، وهم غالباً من غير المتخصصين.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
لكن أيضاً وجدوا أن لطريقة الويكي هذه بعض المميزات للموسوعة.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[104][105] كما أن كتاب الويكي ليسوا كلهم ذوي اختصاص، من سن الطفولة، إلى الكهولة.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
يُنصح لهذا بقراءة الويكي دائما بنظرة ناقدة.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
لدى الإداريين الحق في مسح أية مساهمات غير موثوقة بمصادر تضمن حياديتها، ومصداقيتها.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"تتضمن المعلومات التي تقدمها ويكيبيديا حول العلوم، والانتقادات والجدال حول تأثير وجودة المعلومات وثقافة محرري ويكيبيديا، العلماء، وغير المتخصصين في إدخال المعلومات إلى ويكيبيديا في عام 2016 في مؤسسة ويكيبيديا التعليمية  ومؤسسة سيمونس تم تقديم برنامج يسمى ""عام العلوم"" في هذا البرنامج، حيث قام معلموا الويكيبيديا بزيارة المعارض العلمية ودعوا العلماء للمساهمة بمعلومات في مجالهم وتخصصهم في ويكيبيديا.",Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
بعض الجامعات لديها برنامج يشجع الطلاب على تعديل مقالات ويكيبيديا العلمية كجزء من تجربتهم العلمية ويدعو مجتمع ويكيبيديا العديد من الأكادميين لتحرير مقالات ويكيبيديا.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
أيضا قام العديد من الأكادميين الإجتماعيين بتشجيع الأفراد على تحرير ويكيبيديا.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
في دراسة عام2005 نشرت في مجلة نيتشر تم إجراء مقارنة بين 40 مقالة  علمية من الويكيبيديا الإنجليزية وبين موسوعة بريتانيكا، وجد الخبراء أربع مشاكل جدية في كل من  الويكيبيديا وموسوعة بريتانيكا، ووجدوا أيضاً 162 مشكلة أقل جدية في ويكيبيديا و123 مشكلة أقل جدية في  بريتانيكا.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
مجلة أدبيات علمية كتبت لVice تشتكي في عام 2017 أن مقالات ويكيبيديا العلمية تقنية بشكل كبير.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
كما انتقد وشكك العديد من العلماء والتنظيمات الإعلامية بمحتوى مقالات كل من الموسوعتين من ناحية التأثير العلمي، والنقاشات المتعلقة بالعلوم.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
بالإضافة إلى ويكيبيديا أطلقت مؤسسة ويكيميديا العديد من المشاريع سميت بالمشاريع الشقيقة، ويكي قاموس مشروع قاموس متعدد اللغات بدأ في ديسمبر 2002، ويكي اقتباس الذي يضم مجموعة من الاقتباسات، ويكي الكتب مشروع للكتب المجانية الحرة التي يتم تحريرها تعاونياً.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ويكيميديا تطلق مشاريع عديدة منذ ذلك الحين.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[111] أحدث مشاريع ويكيميديا هو ويكي جامعة مشروع يهدف إلى دعم التعليم الحر واستضافة مصادر تعليمية مجانية.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
مشاريع أخرى مستقلة عن مؤسسة ويكيميديا استوحت الفكرة من طريقة عمل ويكيبيديا التي تعتمد على نظام الويكي والعمل الجماعي، من هذه المشاريع، موسوعة المعرفة، وموسوعة الحياة.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
كما إستوحت موسوعة لاروس طريقة عمل ويكيبيديا لإنشاء موسوعة على الإنترنت يحررها مساهمون غير متخصصين، لكن مع اختلاف في التطبيق فموسوعة لاروس تسمح لمستخدمها أن يكتب مقالاً ويحق له وحده أن يحرره، وهذا النموذج يتفق مع ما تطبقه خدمة نول من جوجل.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[112] الفيلم الوثائقي المستقل الأول عن ويكيبيديا يسمى ""الحقيقة بالأرقام: قصة ويكيبيديا"" Truth in Numbers: The ويكيبيديا Story) عرض في مؤتمر ويكيمانيا 2010.",Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
تم تصويره في العديد من قارات العالم.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
سجل الفيلم تاريخ ويكيبيديا وقدم مقابلات مع العديد من محرري ويكيبيديا حول العالم والآراء المتباينة حولها.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"[113] تعلم الآلة (بالإنجليزية: Machine Learning)‏ هو أحد فروع الذكاء الاصطناعي التي تهتم بتصميم وتطوير خوارزميات وتقنيات تسمح للحواسيب بامتلاك خاصية ""التعلم"".",Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
بشكل عام هناك مستويين من التعلم: الاستقرائي والاستنتاجي.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
يقوم الاستقرائي باستنتاج قواعد وأحكام عامة من البيانات الضخمة.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
المهمة الأساسية للتعلم الآلي هو استخراج معلومات قيمة من البيانات، بالتالي هو قريب جدا من التنقيب في البيانات (بالإنجليزية: data mining)‏ والإحصاء والمعلوماتية النظرية.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[1][2] يستخدم التعلم الآلي في العديد من المجالات من الهندسة إلى الطب.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[2][3][4] يتضمن التعلم الآلي عدداً كبيراً من حقول التطبيقات: معالجة اللغات الطبيعية (بالإنجليزية: natural language processing)‏ وتمييز الأنماط (بالإنجليزية: syntactic pattern recognition)‏ ومحركات البحث (بالإنجليزية: search engines)‏ والتشخيص الطبي والمعلوماتية الحيوية والمعلوماتية الكيميائية، تصنيف تسلسلات الدنا، تمييز الكلام (بالإنجليزية: speech recognition)‏ وتمييز الكتابة handwriting recognition، وحتى تمييز الأشياء (بالإنجليزية: object recognition)‏، رؤية الحاسوب (بالإنجليزية: computer vision)‏ الألعاب الإستراتيجية وتحريك الروبوت (بالإنجليزية: robot locomotion)‏.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"تم استخدام مصطلح ""التعلم الآلي"" لأول مرة في عام 1959 من قبل آرثر صموئيل، وهو أمريكي عمل في شركة آي بي إم.",Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[5] في الستينيات ، كان التعلم الآلي يستخدم في الغالب لتصنيف الأنماط.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"ميتشيل تحديداً مقتبساً واسعة الاقتباس: يقال أَنَّ برنامجا حاسوبياً ""يتعلَّم"" من خبرة 'x' بالنسبة إلى صنف ما من الأَشغال 'y' وبالنسبة إِلى مقياس الإتمامِ z.",Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

وفي هذا الفيديو سأعطيك 10 كلمات ذكية للاستخدام اليومي وفي نهاية هذا الفيديو.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
سأقدم لك أيضًا تلميحًا ذكيًا لجعل رقم الكلمات الذكية بطلاقة حقًا.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
الشخص غارق في الغرق يعني الغرق أو الفيضان ولكن غالبًا ما يستخدم في سياق العمل مثل أنا غارق في العمل لدي الكثير من العمل الذي يجب القيام به ، لقد غمرني العمل هذا الأسبوع بالكامل ، لقد كان لدي وقت بالكاد للتنفس الآن دعنا ننظر إلى جذر هذه الكلمة.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
المستنقع عبارة عن قطعة من الأراضي الرطبة وإذا خطا شخص ما في المكان الخطأ في مستنقع يمكن أن يغرق بسهولة وصيغة الفعل من المستنقع تعني الغرق ، لذا إليك كيفية استخدام هذه الكلمة.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
لنفترض أن لديك الكثير من المهام ولديك اختبار قادم وسيأتي أصدقاؤك إليك ويقولون لك.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
مرحباً ، لماذا لا تتسكع معنا ، يمكنك أن تقول لهم إنني آسف جدًا ولكني غارق في العمل أو أنني غارق في بعض الكلمات الأخرى التي يمكنك استخدامها بدلاً من الغرق ، هل لدي الكثير لكى يفعل.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
هناك الكثير على لوحي أنا غارق في العمل.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
أنا غارق في المهام ، الكلمة الذكية الثانية هي catch-22 الآن أنا متأكد من أنك لقد سمعت هذه الكلمة قبل catch-22 تعني موقفًا مستحيلًا لا يمكنك فيه فعل شيء ما لم تفعل الآخر ولا يمكنك فعل الآخر لأنك لم تفعل الشيء الأول.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
لقد أربكتك ، لذا اسمح لي أن أقدم لك بعض الأمثلة على أن حالة الالتقاط هي عندما لا تحصل على وظيفة دون أن يكون لديك خبرة في العمل.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
لكن لا يمكنك الحصول على الخبرة حتى تحصل على وظيفة ، وقد صاغ جوزيف هيلر 22 في كتابه الشهير الذي يحمل نفس الاسم catch-22 عندما كان يصف بعض القواعد المتناقضة التي كانت تنطبق على الجنود خلال الحرب العالمية الثانية.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
مثال آخر على catch-22 هو أنك بحاجة إلى قرض مصرفي لأنك لا تملك ما يكفي.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
نقودًا ولكنك لن تحصل على هذا القرض المصرفي ما لم تثبت للبنك أن لديك ما يكفي من المال ، لذا تذكر في المرة القادمة التي تواجه فيها موقفًا صعبًا.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
لاستخدام كلمة catch-22.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
واحصل على هذه النظرات المثيرة للإعجاب من أصدقائك ، وكلمات أخرى يمكنك استخدامها بدلاً من catch-22 هي مفارقة أو معضلة كلمة ذكية.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
رقم ثلاثة هو رقيق رقيق رقيق يعني أن تكون متطورًا لتكون مهذبًا ومتوازنًا ورائعًا.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"كلمة ""رقيق"" لها أصول عديدة ومختلفة ولكن مصدر واحد مثير للاهتمام للكلمة وهو ما يعني اللطيف أو المذاق الحلو.",Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
إنه متوازن ولطيف للغاية خاصة أمام السيدات أو أن باراك أوباما لطيف للغاية ولطيف الآن تذكر عندما تكون في حفلة في المرة القادمة وترى هذا الشخص الذي هو كذلك.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
مهذب ومثقف ومتطور.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
لا تنسى أن تقول ، من هو ذلك الرجل اللطيف الموجود في الزاوية ، باستخدام هذه الكلمة سوف يصنع مفرداتك على الفور.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
رقيق للغاية ، كلمة ذكية رقم أربعة فظيعة ، وكلمة فظيعة تعني شيئًا سيئًا فظيعًا فظيعًا مروعًا وحشيًا مروعًا له جذر لاتيني يسمى.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
مما يعني الخوف القاسي أو الرهيب بعض الأمثلة على كلمة فظيعة هي حوادث الاغتصاب الأخيرة في دلهي كانت فظيعة أو يتم معاملة السجناء.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
بطريقة فظيعة أحيانًا في السجون الفظيعة تستخدم أيضًا في الحياة اليومية للحديث عن بعض الأعمال الخاطئة الشائعة وتريد المبالغة فيها.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
على سبيل المثال ، كانت آداب المائدة فظيعة أو أن إحساسها بالملابس فظيع جدًا أو قواعده فظيعة لذلك في المرة القادمة التي تسمع فيها عن عمل مروع في الأخبار تذكر ذلك.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ملاحظة ويقولون إن هذا عمل فظيع.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
الكلمة الذكية رقم 5 هي هائلة ، ورائعة ، ورائعة ، وتعني مذهلًا مذهلاً.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"الآن غالبًا ما نستخدم كلمة رائع هنا "" كلمة أخرى يمكنك استخدامها بدلاً من كلمة رائعة ، على سبيل المثال ، حصلت اليوم على درجة هائلة في اختباري مما يعني أنني حصلت على درجة عالية جدًا أو.",Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
حصلت على درجة شبه مثالية ، فكلمة stupendous لها جذور لاتينية كلاسيكية من الكلمة التي تعني.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
يتم استخدام أن تكون مذهولًا للغاية لوصف شيء جيد بشكل مذهل ، على سبيل المثال تبدو رائعة في هذا الفستان أو ما هو منظر رائع من هذه الشرفة أو أنا أقرأ هذا الكتاب الرائع الذي لا يمكنني أن أخفيه ماذا عنك يخبار.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
أصدقاؤك هذه القناة الرائعة للطلاب وبعض الكلمات الأخرى التي يمكنك استخدامها بدلاً من الهائلة هي رائعة بشكل لا يصدق أو جيدة بشكل استثنائي ، لذا قبل أن نتابع الكلمات الخمس المتوازنة في هذا الفيديو ، تذكر أن تضع تعليقًا أسفل هذا الفيديو.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
أن تخبرني أيًا من هذه الكلمات العشر كانت كلمتك الذكية المفضلة رقم ستة في الإصلاح في الإصلاح يعني أن تكون في موقف مزعج ، على سبيل المثال يا فتى أنا في حالة إصلاح لأنني وضعت خططًا مع صديقين مختلفين لهذا مساء.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
لقد فقدت هاتفي وأنا في إصلاح أو تعطلت حافلتنا هذا الصباح وأنا في إصلاح يلجأ صديقي دائمًا إلي للحصول على المساعدة عندما يكون في إصلاح وعندما يكون الذهاب جيدًا ينسى ذلك.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
أنا ، لذا في المرة القادمة التي تحصل فيها على واجب الرياضيات المنزلي من المدرسة على سبيل المثال ، وإذا تركت كتاب الرياضيات في المدرسة ، فيمكنك إخبار أصدقائك أنك في حل حقيقي الآن ، فقد تعتقد أن كلمة الإصلاح لها ما تفعله بإصلاح شيء ما.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ولكن ليس في الإصلاح يعني أن تكون في موقف مزعج ، وبكلمات أخرى يمكنك استخدامها بدلاً من الإصلاح ، هل أنا في حساء أو أنا m في حالة من الفوضى أو أنا في مكان مزعج أو أنا فقط في مكان ما ، الكلمة الذكية رقم 7 هي flummox flummox تعني إرباك شخص ما.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
لدرجة أنهم نسوا ما يجب عليهم فعله الآن.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
عند انعكاسه في المرآة أو كان السائح في حيرة من أمره بسبب العادات المختلفة التي.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
لقد واجهته أثناء رحلاته أو في مقابلة عندما سُئلت عن سبب تعيينك ، بدت محيرة تمامًا في المرة القادمة إذا كنت مرتبكًا بشأن أي أسئلة على سبيل المثال في امتحان فأنت.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
يمكن أن أقول ذلك دائمًا لأنني لم لقد استعدت جيدًا للامتحان ، لقد شعرت بالحيرة من بعض الأسئلة ، الكلمات الأخرى التي يمكنك استخدامها بدلاً من الحيرة هي محيرة أو محيرة الكلمة الذكية رقم ثمانية هي موعد موعد التقاء.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
هي طريقة فرنسية جدًا لقول لقاء أو موعد ، على سبيل المثال ، لدي موعد مع أصدقائي على الغداء يوم السبت أو أخطط للقاء أصدقائي في المركز التجاري ، حيث يمكن استخدام موعد الأفلام كاسم أو كفعل فمثلا.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
لدي موعد مع أصدقائي هذا المساء أو سألتقي مع أصدقائي غدًا.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
في وقت سابق في فرنسا ، استخدم الجيش موعدًا للإشارة إلى مكان اجتماع للقوات ، والآن هناك شيء مثير وسري بعض الشيء حول كلمة التقاء حتى الآن ، بينما يمكنك استخدام موعد لأي اجتماع.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
بشكل عام لكنها فازت قد يكون مناسبًا جدًا لعقد اجتماع رسمي ، لذا إذا كان لديك تاريخ ، فربما يمكنك بالتأكيد الاتصال بأن كلمة التقاء الذكية رقم 9 منفرجة ومنفرجة المنفرجة إهانة ستستخدمها عندما تحاول الاتصال بشخص ما غبي أو غير ذكي.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
لقد سمعت الآن كلمة منفرجة في الهندسة الزاوية المنفرجة والزاوية الحادة ، لذا فإن الزاوية المنفرجة هي زاوية أكبر من 90 درجة ولكنها أقل من 180 درجة.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
والزاوية الحادة هي هذه الزاوية الحادة التي تقل عن 90 درجة حادة جدًا حيث يتم استخدام كلمة للدلالة على حاد وبالتالي أيضًا حادة عقليًا ومنفرجة تدل على فظة ، وبالتالي فهي بطيئة بعض الشيء في العقل ، لذا فإن الجمل المنفرجة هي الرجل كان بليدًا لدرجة أنه أعطى كلمة المرور الخاصة به إلى متصل مزيف أو طفل منفرج.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
لم يكن قادرا.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
للإجابة على سؤال واحد في الاختبار أو واجه الرجل المنفرج صعوبة في فهم التعليمات الأساسية ، افترض الآن في وضعك في الحياة اليومية أن صديقك أو صديقتك غاضب منك ولا تعرف لماذا يمكنك ذلك.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
قل لهم ربما أكون منفرجًا ولكني لا أعرف لماذا أنت مستاء للغاية ، فالكلمة الذكية رقم 10 هي بطيئة بطيئة بطيئة تعني أن تتحرك بطريقة بطيئة لتكون بطيئًا نوعًا ما.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
من المعتاد أن تبدو متعبًا ومفتقدًا.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
في مثال الطاقة ، وجبة غداء ثقيلة تجعلني في فترة ما بعد الظهيرة بطيئًا لها جذور من الكلمة التي تعني شخصًا بطيئًا ، والسلج هو حيوان يتحرك ببطء شديد مثل أمثلة الحلزون.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
كان الاقتصاد بطيئًا جدًا هذا العام أو تعافى بعد بداية بطيئة.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
أو كان العمل بطيئًا هذا الربع ، يمكنك استخدامه في حياتك اليومية إذا كنت تشعر بالتعب الشديد يومًا ما يمكنك إخبار والدتك أو يمكنك معرفة ذلك.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
أصدقاؤك أشعر بالكسل الشديد.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
اليوم يمكنني أن أفعل مع مشروب طاقة.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
الكلمات الأخرى التي يمكنك استخدامها بدلاً من الكسل يمكن أن تكون خاملة أو تسحب قدمي ، لذا كانت هذه الكلمات العشر الذكية وقبل ذلك.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
أعطيك هذه النصيحة السرية لتبدو بطلاقة للغاية وأريد أن أذكرك أنه في.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
إذا كنت تبحث عن كلمات ذكية لاستخدامها في مكالمة هاتفية ، فأنا أضع رابطًا لمقطع فيديو.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
في مربع الوصف لذلك ، والآن النصيحة السرية للتحدث بطلاقة هي عدم استخدام أكثر من كلمة أو جملة ذكية أعرفها في بعض الأحيان.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
نحن متحمسون جدا لأن.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
نحن' لقد تعلمنا الكثير من هذه الكلمات الذكية ونميل إلى كتابة اثنين وثلاثة أربعة منها في جملة واحدة لا تبدو طبيعية.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
لذلك تأكد واحدًا تلو الآخر من نطقك للكلمة.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
انتقل إلى google واكتب الكلمة وفي الجزء العلوي الأيمن سترى رمز مكبر صوت صغيرًا ، انقر فوق هذا مكبر الصوت.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

عبارات إذا كنت تتعلم اللغة الإنجليزية لفترة من الوقت وتريد استئناف التعلم.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
هذا هو أفضل فيديو نبدأ به ، لذا دعنا ننتقل إلى 50 عبارة باللغة الإنجليزية ونأمل أن تكون 10 دقائق.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
العبارة رقم واحد هذه طريقة أخرى للسؤال.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
كيف حالك؟ كيف الحال أو كيف تسير الأمور؟ كيف تجري الامور؟.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
حتى تلتقي بشخص ما وتوقيت كيف تسير الأمور ؟.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
العبارة الثانية عندما لم ترَ شخصًا ما منذ فترة ، فأنت تخبره بعدم رؤيته لفترة طويلة ، وهذا يعني أنك لم ترَ هذا الشخص ربما أسابيع أو شهورًا منذ وقت طويل بدون رؤية رقم العبارة.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ثلاثة إذا كنت تريد أن تسألك ماذا كنت تفعل.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
تسأل ماذا كنت تفعل فماذا كان يجري في حياتك ؟.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ماذا كنت تفعل لتربيهم من قبل إذا كان كل شيء يسير؟ حسنًا ، يمكنك الإجابة فقط لا يمكنك الشكوى من كل شيء رائع حقًا.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
لا يمكنك الشكوى من العبارة التالية يخبرك شخص ما بشيء ما ولم تذكره حقًا في المحادثة كما يظنون بطريقة ما أن لديك وظيفة جديدة ، وأنت تسأله.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
كيف علمت بذلك؟.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
من أين حصلت على الأخبار مثل كيف لك.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
تعرف على ما إذا كان شخص ما يقول نكتة رائعة يمكنك أن تقول إنها جيدة.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
هذه مزحة رائعة لذا فإن العبارة جيدة.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
إذا كنت تريد أن تشكر شخصًا ما ، فيمكنك أن تقول إنه لطف منك ، شكرًا جزيلاً لك على القيام بذلك ، هذا لطف منك ، إنه لطف منك إذا كان هناك شخص ما.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
كان يحاول مساعدتك ، لكن لم يستطع الوصول إلى النتيجة التي يمكنك قولها.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
شكرا لك على أي حال لا يهم ، لكن شكرا لك على أي حال.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
شكرا على مجهودك.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
لا ، شكرًا على أي حال ، وعبارة أخرى أستخدمها في رسالتي الإلكترونية أحيانًا عندما لا أطلب شخصًا.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
أسأل ثم أقول في النهاية.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
شكرًا لك مقدمًا ، مما يعني أنني أتمنى حقًا أن تفعل ذلك.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
افعل ذلك شاكرا لكم مقدما.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
شكرًا لك مقدمًا إذا ارتكب شخص ما خطأ ، وهو منزعج حقًا من ذلك.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
يمكنك فقط أن تقول لا تقلق.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
لا تقلق ولا تقلق مما يعني لا تقلق بشأنه.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
لا بأس.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
لا تقلق تخيل أنك عدت إلى المنزل وهناك جميع أصدقائك جالسين على أريكتك.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
وأنت مثل ما يحدث هنا مثل ماذا تفعل هنا ؟.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ما الذي يحدث إذا لم تلتقط شيئًا أو لم تفهم الشخص الذي يمكنك دائمًا سؤاله هل فهمتك بشكل صحيح ؟.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ثم انطلق وشرح من أين حصلت ، هل فهمتك بشكل صحيح ؟.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
إذا طلبت من شخص ما ألا ينزعج ولا يبكي ، يمكنك القول لا تأخذ الأمر على محمل الجد.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
لا تأخذ الأمر على محمل الجد على محمل الجد لا تنزعج ولا تأخذ الأمر على محمل الجد.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
طريقة أخرى للسؤال عما إذا لم تلتقط جزءًا من العبارة ، يمكنك القول إنني لم أفهم الكلمة الأخيرة.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
أنا آسف.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
هل يمكنك تكراره لأنني لم أفهم الكلمة الأخيرة إذا كان يريد من شخص ما أن يكرر العبارة بأكملها مرة أخرى.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
يمكنك أن تقول آسف.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
لم أكن أستمع لأنك ربما كنت مشغولاً.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ربما كنت تتحدث على الهاتف وكان شخص ما يتحدث معك ، وأنت مثل.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
يا إلهي.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
آسف لم أكن أستمع.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ممكن تكررها ؟.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
أنا آسف.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
لم أكن أستمع إلى عبارة أخرى أستخدمها طوال الوقت.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
لا يهم مثل لا تقلق إذا أسقطت قهوتك فوقي.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
يبدو الأمر كما لو أنه لا يهم.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
سأكون بخير.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
أنا' م ذاهب إلى الغسيل على أي حال.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
لا يهم إذا كنت ترغب في أن يحالف الحظ شخص ما.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
وأنا أفعل ذلك دائمًا ، يمكنك أن تقول إن الأصابع متقاطعة وأنت تتخطى الأصابع هكذا.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
تشابك الاصابع.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"عبارة أخرى يستخدمها الأمريكيون هي ""يا سيئة"" التي تفسرها و.",Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
الموقف هو أنك لم تحصل على شيء ثم تحصل على تأثير إضافي ، وتحصل عليه.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
وأنت مثل هذا ما يفسر ذلك.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
هناك طريقة أخرى لإخبار الشخص بأنه لا ينزعج ، وهي أن تقول أن الأشياء تحدث كما لو كانت على ما يرام.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
تحدث الأشياء فلا تنزعج إذا لم يكن لديك اسم شخص تريد التحدث معه.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
يمكنك أن تقول آسف لإزعاجك تعلم أنك ترى.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
شخص ما مشغول ، يمكنك دائمًا أن تقول آسف لإزعاجك ثم يمكنك المضي قدمًا والسؤال.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
آسف لإزعاجك.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
إذا كنت في وسط شيء ما في شخص ما ' أسألك شيئًا يمكنك قوله ، أنت في منتصف شيء ما وشخص ما يطلب منك شخص ما أن تفعل شيئًا تقوله ، أنا آسف.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
سأكون معك بعد دقيقة وسأكون معك ومن ثم تستأنف القيام بشيء ما وتقول أين كنا.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
مثل متى توقفنا عن مكان وجودنا وعليك تكراره لأنه الصوت الذي يخطئ به شخص ما.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
لذا فهذه طريقة رائعة للتدرب على أين كنا مرة أخرى إذا كنت في منتصف محادثة؟ ولم تفهم ما كان يقوله الشخص الآخر ، يمكنك أن تقوله بعلامة استفهام.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ما يعني الذي يدفع الشخص للتكرار مرة أخرى؟ كنت تقول .,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
إذا حصل شخص ما على وظيفة أحلامه في كل ما يمكنك قوله محظوظًا أو دخل أي شخص إلى الجامعة ، فإن أحلامه مثل محظوظ ، فهذه طريقة لتهنئة الشخص المحظوظ أو مجرد التأكيد على أنه محظوظ لك بطريقة أخرى إن كنت غاضبًا حقًا هو أن أقول إنني شعرت بالخوف كما لو كنت غاضبًا جدًا.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
أوه ، هذا جنوني تقريبًا.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
لقد أخافت عبارة أخرى يستخدمها المتحدثون الأصليون مفيدة لك ويمكن أن يكون هذا إيجابيًا وسلبيًا عندما تقول إنني حصلت على ترقية وإذا قالوا جيدًا لك ، فأحب التهنئة وأحيانًا إذا قلت أنني سأغادر هذا المكان.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
إنها جيدة بالنسبة لك ، سيكون أفضل بدونك وهذا معنى سلبي ، لذا استمع حقًا إلى التنغيم.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
إذا فاجئك شيء ما ، يمكنك أيضًا أن تقول إنه يجب أن تمزح معي مثل يا إلهي.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
لا أستطيع أن أصدق أنه يجب عليك أن تمزح لي أن تخبر أحدًا أن يبتسم ولكي تكون سعيدًا يمكنك دائمًا أن تقول ابتهج ابتهج.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
إذا كنت تريد شخصًا يبدو وكأنه يبكي ويشكو من شيء لا يحدث ، يمكنك أن تقول تعال ، هل يمكنك فعل ذلك أنا؟ هيا.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
يمكنك القيام بذلك ، يمكنك تمرير التوفل ، يمكنك تمرير gmat التي ستحصل عليها.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
يمكنك القيام بذلك إذا كان هناك شخص ما يقوم بعمل جيد حقًا ، يمكنك إخبارهم بمواصلة العمل الجيد ، واستمر في العمل الجيد مثل أن تكون جيدًا مثلك واستمر في العمل الجيد ، استمر في أن تكون عبارة أخرى عامية ، وهذا ما يفعله الأمريكيون قل.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
هذا مضاء مما يعني أن الكثير من الأمريكيين قالوا إن هذا مذهل في كاليفورنيا أوه هذا مضاء وربما سمعته في الأغاني التي يضيء إذا كان شخص ما ناجحًا بعد الفشل ، لذلك يمكنك أن تقول هناك تذهب ، أخبرتك أنك ستصل إلى هناك تذهب إذا سألك شخص ما إذا كنت متعبًا وتريد أن تقول أنك لست متعبًا على الإطلاق لا أستطيع أن أقول لا قليلا ناه.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
أريد أن أستمر ، لست متعبًا من ذلك عندما يسألك أحدهم ، هل أنت متأكد وأنت متأكد تمامًا من أنه لا يوجد مكان لذلك؟ لا يوجد مجال للشك في أمريكا إذا كنت تريد إرسال رسالة نصية إلى شخص ما أو إرسال رسالة تقولها نصًا إلى نص ، لذلك سأرسل لك رسالة نصية تعني أنني سأرسل لك رسالة عبر whatsapp أو برقية أو رسول مهما كان ما سأستخدمه أرسل لك رسالة نصية مرة أخرى لتشجيع شخص ما لتخبره ألا ينزعج ، يمكنك القول إن الأمر لا يستحق ذلك مثل لماذا تبكي؟ لا يستحق كل هذا العناء.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"أنت أفضل بكثير من المشكلة التي تبكي عليها "" لا تستحق دموعك.",Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
لا يستحق كل هذا العناء ، أنا شخصياً أحب العبارة التي تعني أنك رائع.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
يا إلهي.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
أنت صخرة لا ، لقد قمت بعمل رائع.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
إذا كان شخص ما لا يعمل بشكل جيد حقًا ، وتريد منه أن يعمل بجدية أكبر ، يمكنك أن تقول إنه يجب عليك أن تمضي مسافة إضافية مما يعني أنه مثل العمل بجدية أكبر ، يجب أن تقطع ميلًا إضافيًا.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
طريقة أخرى لقول نفس الشيء تمامًا يمكنك أن تقوله صعد لعبتك مثل العمل بجد والعمل بشكل أفضل تصعيد لعبتك.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
إذا كان هناك من يبكي ولا يريد ذلك.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
إنها تغرق وتقول إنها تجمع بين نفسك مثل خذ نفسك حرفيًا واجمع نفسك معًا ، توقف عن العمل ، توقف عن البكاء ، اجمع نفسك معًا.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
مهلا تهدئة نفسك معا عبارة أخرى.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
أحبك بعتني لأن الناس في بعض الأحيان يصفون رحلتهم أو شخص اشتروه ويصفون أنه جيد جدًا.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
وهم يشبهونني أريد أن أشتري نفس الشيء وأقول لهم إنك بعتني بعتني لن أشتري هذا جيدًا ، لقد بعتني إذا لم تكن مهتمًا بالمحادثة.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
أنت تحب الجلوس ، يمكنك القول أنني لا أستطيع أن أهتم كثيرًا ، فهذا ممل جدًا.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
أنا لست مهتم.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
لا يمكنني أن أقلل من اهتمامك إذا سألك أحدهم شيئًا وهذا قرار سهل حقًا بالنسبة لك كما يخبرك أحدهم بأنك تأخذ مليون دولار وتقول إن هذا أمر غير منطقي.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
أنا سأخذه.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
هذا أمر لا يحتاج إلى تفكير يعني أنه قرار سهل حقًا بالنسبة لك إذا كنت قد فعلت شيئًا خاطئًا وتعترف أنه يمكنك القول إنني أفسدت نعم يا رفاق.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
أنا أعلم.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
أنا آسف.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
انا ثمل.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
هذا هو خطأي.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
لقد أخفقت في الأمر إذا كنت تريد أن يعمل شخص ما بدلاً مني.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
هل يمكنك تغطيني مثل هل يمكنك العمل بدلاً مني بينما أنا م رؤية صديقي.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
هل يمكنك أن تغطيني لقد حان وقت المغادرة ، ومن الأفضل أن أذهب يا رفاق مما يعني أنني يجب أن أذهب بالفعل.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
أنت تعلم.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
إنها في الواقع الساعة 1 9 مساءً.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
الآن.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
من الأفضل أن أذهب بطريقة أخرى لأقول وداعًا.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
أستطيع أن أقول اعتني بنفسك ، مما يعني اعتني بنفسك سوف اراك لاحقا.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
اعتن بنفسك.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
لا أعرف ما هو اليوم الذي تشاهد فيه هذا الفيديو ، لكن إذا كان يوم الجمعة على سبيل المثال عطلة نهاية الأسبوع.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
يمكنك أن تقول الحمد لله هو يوم الجمعة أو تعتقد أن السماء قالت اكتشاف السبت نهاية الأسبوع.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
أنا سعيد جدًا لأن هذا كان عبارة عن 50 عبارة باللغة الإنجليزية ، أخبرني ما إذا كان هذا مفيدًا من خلال الإعجاب بهذا الفيديو والتعليق أدناه إذا كنت تعرف أي عبارات رائعة أخرى.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
سيكون ذلك رائعًا ، فهناك زر أحمر في مكان ما.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
أهلا ومرحبا.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
في هذا الفيديو سأعطيك 100 جملة شائعة ومفيدة للغاية يمكنك استخدامها في المحادثة.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ماذا عنك؟ ليس كثيرا.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ابق على تواصل.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

دعني أفكر للحظة.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
يطلب التكرار.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
عفوا؟ آسف ، لم أفهم ذلك.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"هل تمانع من تكرار ذلك؟ هل يمكنك التحدث ببطء أكثر ، من فضلك؟ قائلا ""لا أعرف"".",Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
أخشى أنه ليس لدي فكرة.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
لا أستطيع مساعدتك هناك ، آسف.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
يضربني.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
الآراء.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ما رأيك في ذلك؟ ما هي وجهة نظرك حول هذا؟ أعتقد أن هذه فكرة جيدة.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
بصراحة لا أعتقد أنها ستنجح.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
بقدر ما أشعر بالقلق ، هذا هو أفضل مطعم في المدينة.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
تجنب السؤال.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ليس لدي رأي في الموضوع.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
اسمحوا لي أن نعود اليكم في هذا الشأن.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ليس لدي الحرية في القول.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
الاتفاق والاختلاف.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
لا يمكن اقبل المزيد.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
أنت محق تماما.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
أتفق معك 100٪.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
كنت أصاب كبد الحقيقة على رأسه.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

الخبز الذهبي في قرية صغيرة عاشت امرأة اسمها ماريون.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
مع ابنتها الوحيدة ، كانت narcisa ماريون متواضعة للغاية ولطيفة ، ولكن كان العكس تمامًا كما ترى ، كانت جميلة بما يتجاوز الكلمات التي كانت تعيشها.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
الدمية والجزء الأكثر إمتاعًا هو أنها أحببت نفسها بلا نهاية.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ساعدني في خبز الخبز ، هاه بأي حال من الأحوال أمي الخادمات الطحين كل عيني المشرقة والمتألقة.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
narcisa ، هل ستساعدني في زرع هذه البذور ، فما الذي يجعلني أفعل ذلك ، ما الذي يجعل كل هذه الأوساخ على أصابعي الجميلة أسوأ ، ماذا لو كانت على وجهي جيدًا كانت هذه هي مشكلة Narcisa.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
لقد اعتقدت أنها أكبر من أن تقوم بأي عمل جاء العديد من الخاطبين لطلب يد النرجس للزواج.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
نظرًا لأن جمالها كان معروفًا على نطاق واسع لكنها رفضتهم جميعًا بوقاحة شديدة ، فلماذا طردت هؤلاء الرجال بعيدًا أمس بدوا لطيفين ، لا يمكنك أن تكون جادًا أمي واحد منهم.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
كان لديه عيون صغيرة مثل عصفور والآخر لديه أنف ضخم لا أريد أن أكون بالقرب منه عندما عطس أوه أوه والمحطة الأخيرة لا ، لا أريد أن أسمع أكثر من ذلك ، كل ما استطعت رؤيته هو أن هؤلاء الرجال كانوا لطفاء حقًا يا عزيزي ، يجب أن تعرف هذا الجمال.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ليس كل شيء يا أم عليك أن تدرك أنني أستحق شخصًا مثل أمير أو فارس.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
يا عزيزتي ذات ليلة عندما كانت نائمة جلست والدتها بجانبها تراقبها.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
طفلي العزيز ، أنت جميلة ورائعة لكنك لا تهتم بأي شيء سوى جمالك.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
في تلك اللحظة بدأت النرجس بالضحك أثناء نومها كانت والدتها متفاجئة للغاية بمدى روعة حلمها المضحك في صباح اليوم التالي عندما كانت نرجس استيقظت كانت كل الابتسامات والضحكات هنا عزيزتي قل لي بماذا كنت تحلم.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
الليلة الماضية حسناً أمي ، لقد كان حلمًا رائعًا كما تعلم أن هناك هذا الأمير الذي جاء إلي.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
وقال إنه يريد أن يتزوجني لقد جاء في عربة ذهبية وكان يرتدي ملابس من أعلى إلى أسفل وذهب وكذلك يا له من حلم سخيف.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
وأنت تعرف أن أفضل جزء منه كان عندما كنت أرتدي فستان زفافي الذي كان من الذهب أيضًا بالطبع كان الجميع يحدق في أنا فقط ، لا يوجد شيء مدهش في هذا الحلم.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
لقد كان حلمًا مغرورًا جدًا يا أمي ، فأنت لا تعرف ما تقوله ، لقد جعلني الحلم أدرك أنني بحاجة إلى طعام أكبر بكثير من النوع الذي أتناوله هنا في المنزل ، خبز مصنوع من الذهب.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
مجرد التفكير في تلك الأم المسكينة النرجسية كانت قلقة للغاية بشأن ابنتها وكيف.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
كانت ستعيش حياتها في ذلك اليوم جاء صديقان لزيارة والدتهما النرجسية وهما ميلي وتيري ، كان الثلاثة منهم أصدقاء منذ زمن طويل ، لكن تيري وإيلي كان لديهما سر.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
كانوا كائنات سحرية شيئًا لم تعرفه والدة نارسيس شيئًا عن تيري ميلي ، من الجيد جدًا رؤيتك لقد مضى وقت طويل جدًا ' كيف حالك لقد كنت جيدًا جدًا ، كنت سأكون أفضل لو كانت ابنتي نرسيسا فقط أكثر تفهمًا قليلاً أخبرت ماريان ميلي وتيري كل شيء عن نارسيس وكيف كانت قلقة عليها تريد أن تأكل الخبز المصنوع من الذهب ماذا أفعل بها جيدًا ربما إذا تحقق حلمها سيكون ذلك رائعًا ، أليس كذلك جيدًا بغض النظر عن الوقت الذي أعتقد أنها ستنمو لتتعلم فلنتحدث عن شيء آخر.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
الآن لاحقًا في وقت لاحق ، لوح ميلي وتيري وداعًا لصديقهما القديم وذهبا مبتسمين لبعضهما البعض سرا في تلك الليلة كل من الأم وابنتها.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
استعدت للنوم يا أمي ، آمل حقًا أن يتحقق حلمي ، فأنت تعلم يا نارسسا في اليوم التالي حيث كانت نارسسا ووالدتها بالخارج في حديقتهم الجميلة.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
جاءت عربة ذهبية متجهة إليهم كانت مرصعة بالأحجار الكريمة والماس وتبدو مذهلة للغاية.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
عندما توقفت ، خرج منه رجل وسيم ونظر إلى نارسسا ، لقد فوجئت تمامًا بمدى وسيمه الذي كان حلمي يتحقق بالفعل.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ما مرحباً جئت إلى هنا لأطلب الزواج من نرجس ولكن كيف تعرف اسمها ومن أنت.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
أنا مرعوب من ملاك الحظ السعيد اسم ابنتك وجمالها معروف في جميع أنحاء العالم هنا لقد أحضرت لك هدية ولكنك بالكاد تعرفه لا يمكنك الذهاب معه.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
يا سخيف ، إنه ثري ووسيم أكثر ما يمكن أن أريده أكثر من ذلك أنا أقبل اقتراحك.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
وبهذا دخلت عربته وبدون حتى أن تقول وداعًا لأمها انطلقت مع الملاك بينما كانوا يسافرون ، دخلت العربة فجأة إلى بوابة سحرية هناك ، سارت عبر منطقة عاصفة اصطدمت العربة حولها بشكل هائل ونرجسية.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
كنت خائفًا جدًا ، لا تقلق يا عزيزي ، فكل هذا سينتهي قريبًا تمامًا كما قال إن العربة مرت عبر بوابة أخرى ووصلت إلى الممر.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
من قلعة ذهبية ضخمة ورائعة ، كانت نارسيسا مندهشة من كل الجمال الذي رأته ، كنت أعرف أنني أستحق الكثير من الثروات ، كنت أعلم أنك ستعجبك أي شيء تريده ستجده هنا من أجمل الفساتين إلى ألذ الأطعمة كلها في قصري أتحدث جيدًا عن الطعام ، فأنا جائع حقًا بعد تلك الرحلة.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
أتضور جوعا هل يمكنني الحصول على أي من هذا الطعام اللذيذ بالطبع هنا ميليسا اللحم ذات الرائحة الكريهة ستحصل على كل ما تريد ، لقد سمعت الكثير عنك أنت يا مسكين عزيزي أنت جائع ، ألست تعال لنذهب إلى طاولة الطعام و سأحضر لك بعض الطعام ، شكرًا لك ، لقد ذهبوا إلى غرفة الطعام وكان هناك على الطاولة أكثر الأطعمة المدهشة التي شاهدها Narcisa على الإطلاق ، وهذا لأنه صنع المربيات.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
من الياقوت ، سلطات الزمرد والخبز الموجود هناك مصنوع من الخبز الذهبي الذهبي ، كم سيبدو هذا المربى جميلًا وطعمه الجميل مع الخبز الذي أخذت شريحة منه.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
مربى الياقوت عليها وأخذت قضمة كبيرة ، هذا حار جدًا ، لا يمكنني تناول هذا جيدًا ، إنه خبز مصنوع من الذهب والأفضل أيضًا ، لكن إذا لم تستطع تناوله ، فهل يجب أن أحضر لك خبزًا فضيًا فضيًا ، أليس كذلك؟ انت تأكل.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
شيء آخر ولكني أريد خبزًا عاديًا يمكنني تناوله ، أليس كذلك لديك هذا المظهر ، لذا فالزوجة المستقبلية لصدفة مولاي تكون باردة ، يجب عليك فقط تناول أفضل أنواع النرجس التي تنظر إليها جميع الأطعمة.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
لكن حزن القلب بسبب كل ما كان هناك غير صالح للأكل ، سرعان ما بدأت في البكاء لا أريد هذا ولكن الطعام جيد حقًا.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
هنا جرب بعض البطاطس الذهبية فهي جيدة حقًا وبعد أن تتزوجني.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
عليك أن تأكل كل هذا ، أعتقد أنك تحب الأشياء الفاخرة ، لا أريد أن أتزوجك أريد العودة إلى المنزل.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
إلى والدتي ، دعني أذهب إلى المنزل ميليسا ونظر تيرنس إلى بعضهما البعض وغمز بشكل جيد.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
إذا كان هذا هو ما تريده حقًا ، فسوف آخذك إلى المنزل ، حيث أخذ الفزع يبكي ويبكي.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
نارسيس في المنزل في العربة بدأت تفكر بعمق في الخيارات التي اتخذتها عندما وصلت إلى المنزل.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ركضت لتعانق والدتها التي كانت جالسة في المنزل حزينة ولا أخت يا ابنتي الحلوة اعتقدت أنني لن أراك مرة أخرى.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
يا أمي ، أنا أحبك كثيرًا وكنت تبدو جيدًا والثروات ليست كل شيء كان الخبز الذهبي عديم الفائدة لأنني لم أستطع أكله والرجل رغم ذلك.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
لقد كان وسيمًا ولم يهتم بي على الإطلاق ولكن عزيزي هل تدرك أن هذه هي الطريقة التي تعاملت بها مع الآخرين وأنا أعلم أنني آسف جدًا للطريقة التي تصرفت بها أمي ، لا ، لا بأس بما أنك رأيت.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ما هو خطأك ، فلنطعمك شيئًا لطيفًا من ذلك اليوم فصاعدًا.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
غيرت narcisa طرقها التي كافحت في البداية ولكن ببطء وصبر بدأت تصبح أجمل كثيرًا ذات يوم جاء ميلي وتيري لمقابلة ماريان مرة أخرى.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
كيف' أخبرتهم النرجسية الآن ماريان بكل ما حدث وتغيرت كثيرًا منذ ذلك الوقت.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
هل أعتقد أنها لن تريد المزيد من الخبز الذهبي الآن ، هاه تعلمون.,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
تيري تبدو في الواقع مثل هذا الملاك قليلاً على الرغم من أن ما أراه كيف يمكن أن تكونا له أنتما لطيفان للغاية,Arabic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
